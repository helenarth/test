Multiple \nrelated applications (e.g. multiple Qt-4 applications)? Every application? \n \nSingle -> that app. \nMultiple -> that library / related \"thing\". Or any one of the applications, \nbut include information about which other applications are affected. \nEvery -> Probably your window manager, maybe X. \n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr. ,= ,-_-. =. \nbss@iguanasuicide.net ((_/)o o(\\_)) \nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy `-'(. .)`-' \nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/ \\_/",
