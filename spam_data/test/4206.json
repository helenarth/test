Some of the deals include a new $200 mail-in rebate on desktops, while others offer instant $50 rebates. HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 15.23 -0.13% \n \nShareholders sue PayPal, eBay \nThe PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.\nThe lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday. EBAY INC 60.38 2.63% \n \nSAP cuts forecast, shows Q2 loss \nEurope's biggest software maker, SAP AG, shocked the market on Thursday by unexpectedly cutting its sales forecast and missing analysts' forecast for the second quarter.\n\nThe company said it would post a net loss of 235 million euros ($232 million) and said it was taking a non-recurring accounting charge of 414 million euros to cover impairments of minority investments in the United States, including a 318 million euros charge from its 20 percent stake in Commerce One.

Although the results look solid at first, Baldauf and Gernitis say Yahoo's growth was driven entirely by new initiatives. They also argue the firm's improved outlook seems driven completely by the Overture deal extension. Eventually, these initiatives will result in much lower growth rates, the analysts say. They argue Yahoo's stock price isn't supported by the firm's fundamentals.
