Nell McAndrew and\n Rhona Cameron contribute to a slightly vague interpretation of\n \"celebrity\" in I'M A CELEBRITY - GET ME OUT OF HERE! (8pm,\n Sun, ITV)... WHEN [DIANA] DIED - DEATH OF A PRINCESS (9pm,\n Sun, C4) contains \"scenes of nudity and religious ritual\" -\n funny what people find offensive nowadays ... and Jeff \"Tron\"\n Bridges plays the other half of that K-Pax double-act in\n STARMAN (2.30pm, Mon, C5) - all together now: \"You don't\n understand, Mrs Hayden: that *thing* is no longer your\n husband!\"... archaeology imitates \"Coneheads\" in ANCIENT\n MURDER MYSTERY: RIDDLE OF THE CONE-SHAPED SKULLS (8pm, Mon,\n C5)... odd scheduling for Bill Murray's kid-friendly identity\n mixup THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE (11.05pm, Tue, BBC1)... and\n if only they'd got hold of Tim Burton's recent \"reimagining\"\n to show after the run of BATTLE FOR/ FAREWELL TO/ BACK TO\n THE PLANET OF THE APES (1.30pm, Tue-Thu, ITV), you could have\n watched the franchise deteriorate before your very eyes...\n\n FILM>> good to see Time Magazine's staff staying cool long\n enough to publish their final \"Humanity Doomed\" collectors'\n edition for the backstory of \"X-Files\" director Rob Bowman's\n \"2000AD\"-style Brit-set monster apocalypse REIGN OF FIRE\n ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/reignoffire.htm : \"Here's\n to evolution!\"; many deaths by incineration; child permitted\n in hardhat construction area; massive tattoos)... it's Martin\n \"Bad Boys\" Lawrence and Academy Award nominee Tom \"In The\n Bedroom\" Wilkinson - together at last! - in funnier-than-\n you'd-expect \"Galaxy Quest\"/\"A Knight's Tale\" hybrid BLACK\n KNIGHT ( http://www.screenit.com/movies/2001/black_knight.html :\n [Lawrence] does all sorts of mugging and facial contortions at\n the camera that some kids might want to imitate; we hear the\n King fart at dinner; some kids might want to imitate all of\n the action-based fighting that occurs)... or there's badfilm\n stalwart Heather Graham and \"My Cousin Vinny\" Academy Award\n winner Marisa \"In The Bedroom\" Tomei in clumsy Bollywood porn\n comedy pastiche THE GURU ( http://www.bbfc.co.uk/ : Contains\n strong sex references and language)...\n\n DRESS DOWN FRIDAY>> after an unexpected 3-month hiatus -\n because, hey, who buys t-shirts in the summer? - NTK's online\n store is back to full strength at http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/\n and now features lengthy explanations of exactly what PayPal\n will attempt to charge you. Also new this month: lots of\n designs now available in XXL, including the ever-popular 404\n /SHIRT/TIE NOT FOUND, a glow-in-the-dark variant of the ZX\n font BORN TO RUN one, plus slightly more limited numbers of\n the arcade-style HI-SCORE TABLE and the last few remaining\n souvenirs from June's EXTREME COMPUTING show. Oh and copies of\n Mark Bennett's BLACK ICE magazine (for just US$7 plus postage\n and packing) - Brighton's very own answer to \"Mondo 2000\"...\n meanwhile, your entries have continued to flood in, a leading\n contender being CHRIS HOWE's possibly Designers-Republic-\n influenced http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/chrismessiah.gif\n - though his email address appears to have changed recently,\n so if anyone knows where he is, could you ask him to get in\n touch? We also enjoyed JAMES SWIFT's politically motivated\n http://www.3dengineer.com/tshirts/privacylogged.gif , BRUCE's\n heartfelt http://www.growf.org/shirts/crack.gif , and ASHLEY\n POMEROY's whimsical http://www.ashleypomeroy.com/arpshirts.gif\n - but remained puzzled by people sending us what appear to be\n parodies of our existing parody designs, from OWAIN KENWAY's\n http://www.angelfire.com/scifi2/dsky/1337spotting.html through\n to JOF's http://www.overhope.org.uk/misc/revolution.jpg and\n PAUL \"THE FRIDAY THING\" CARR's perhaps over-self-explanatory:\n http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/tft-shirt.jpg . And if your\n design skills aren't up to this high standard, you can of\n course just mail us a text slogan, so long as it's at least as\n funny as SIMON LIPSON's \"NTK: ROTFL meets ROT-13\", ANDREW\n SIMMONS' \"NTK: Notes you don't want to save, and for link\n evaluation\", or PHIL SOUTH's \"Frieze - Marther - Farquhar\" -\n but designed to look like it's the name of a law company!...\n meanwhile, the http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/ gallery\n reveals the \"Buy One, Subvert The Mass Media, Get One Free\"\n contest to be hotting up once again, as 25-year-old web\n designer GRAEME DAVISON \"just happened\" to be wearing the\n shirt that spells \"fuck\" in ASCII URL-encoding when he was\n photographed by THE NORTHERN ECHO about his trip to see\n \"Attack Of The Clones\" open in LA. Even though this was only a\n local newspaper, the judging panel felt he deserved the full\n prize (of another t-shirt), as the story goes on to cover the\n ostensibly pointless nature of the entire exercise. That's the\n kind of product placement that money just can't buy...\n\n >> SMALL PRINT 500KB attachments is forbidden by the Geneva Convention.\n Your country may be at risk if you fail to comply.",
