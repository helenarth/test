With shares of SBC Communications, Qwest Communications International, Sprint and AT&T also dropping, CNET's Tech index shed 48.86 points, or 5.3 percent, to 897.37. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 36.5 points, or 2.77 percent, to 1,282.55.\n \nWith a report raising questions about Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s role in the Enron fiasco, broader markets lost ground as well. After a see-saw session, the Dow Jones industrials ended down 234.7 points, or 2.93 percent, to 7,784.5. The S&P 500 slid 27.90 points, or 3.29 percent, to 819.85.\n \n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nBellSouth posts lower second-quarter profits \nBellSouth Corp., the No. 3 U.S. local telephone company, on Monday posted lower second-quarter profits due to slack demand and turbulent economic conditions in North America and Latin America.\n\nBellSouth, the dominant local telephone company in nine Southeastern states from Kentucky to Florida, said net income fell to 16 cents a share from 47 cents a year earlier. BELLSOUTH CORP 22.61 -18.11% \n \nWorldCom, BellSouth news adds to telecom gloom \nWorldCom Inc.'s bankruptcy filing is only the latest in a long line of sad news for a slumping telecom industry grappling with soft demand, falling earnings and worries about accounting.\n\nAnd things are not likely to change any time soon, as signaled by BellSouth Corp.'s disappointing second-quarter earnings and downward revision to its full-year outlook, analysts and investors said on Monday. WORLDCOM INC-WORLDCOM TRCK STK 0.14 55.56% \n \nHP seeks Texas justice; Gateway dinged \nIn separate court cases, a Florida jury dinged Gateway for sending phone calls to the wrong business, and a federal court in Houston issued an injunction barring Emachines from selling products that infringe on Hewlett-Packard patents.\nA jury in Florida ruled last week that Gateway must pay $3.6 million for a typo in which it sent customers with a PC problem to an 800 number owned by Pensacola, Fla.-based Mo' Money Associates instead of the company's own complaint line, which had a similar number but with an 888 prefix.

He anticipates earnings guidance for the current quarter of 15-20 cents per share. The stock could move a bit higher, but FitzGerald believes better data from end markets is needed for a sustained rally. He also expects the firm to announce it will pay back $880 million in debt.

But perhaps more important, Swartz was a key adviser and architect in Dennis Kozlowski's decade-long acquisition binge to build Tyco into one of the world's largest manufacturing conglomerates.
