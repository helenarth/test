The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 7.36 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,375.26.\n \nWorse-than-expected earnings from construction machinery maker Caterpillar helped depress broader markets.

He also notes Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large, untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee suggests the stock is fairly valued. He believes shares of POWI are unlikely to rise much in the short term.
