    "body": "Dear all \n \nOn an up-to-date testing machine, I am using Iceweasel + tor + privoxy. \nFlorian helped me with an issue like this sometime back, but revisiting \nhis helpful advice has not helped on this occasion. \n \nThe situation is as follows: \n \nUsing Iceweasel, I enable the tor button and receive a warning message \n\"Tor proxy test: local HTTP proxy is unreachable. Is polipo running \nproperly?\" \n \nWell, no because polipo wasn't installed - why and when this suddenly \nbecame a necessity I don't know, but anyway I installed polipo and \nconfigured it according to the tutorial on \nhttp://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Polipo which, in my circumstances, \nrequired me to uncomment this line in the config file: \n \n socksParentProxy = localhost:9050 \n \nHaving restarted the daemons, and still getting the same error and no \nconnection, I pointed the browser at privoxy as per the polipo \nconfiguration page referred to above, in the preferences/ network \nsettings tab, and in the polipo config file, I uncommented the line: \n \n socksParentProxy = localhost:9050 \n \nI then restarted polipo, double-checked the privoxy config file to \nensure that forwarding was still set as required and restarted the tor \nand privoxy daemons. However, I still get the same error messages \n(basically cannot connect to web-pages) and the tor test gives the same \nresults as before. \n \n From researching this on the web, I am unable to ascertain whether or \nnot I even need polipo, but the preferences settings tab for the tor \nbutton have a check-box for using polipo, so it appears as if tor is now \nexpecting polipo to be installed and running as default. But, I have \nnow reached the limit of what I know what to do or can figure out. I am \nalso conscious of the risk of screwing things up further in an effort to \nfix this, so before proceeding further would like to ask this list for \nhelp and advice. \n \nI appreciate any thoughts/ ideas. \n \nThanks \n \nAG \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
