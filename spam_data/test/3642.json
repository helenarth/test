Again this is just a personal \nperception. I know that some packages have very active maintainer(s) \nand others not. \n \nI've not checked it out closely, but is alioth.debian.org similar to \nUbuntu's Launchpad where community members can set up their own personal \narchive? It seems as though someone who shows a personal interest and \n(pardon the pun) aptitude with packaging could thus gain some \nrecognition and become a maintainer with a bit more effort. Perhaps I \nam all wrong. \n \n- Nate >> \n \n-- \n \n\"The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all \npossible worlds.
