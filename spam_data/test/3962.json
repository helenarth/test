    "body": "I edited /etc/resolv.conf to add a nameserver, edited /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf \nto do the same and added the dns to wicd. However, I keep getting the same \nold dns from the router, i.e., resolv.conf keeps changing to the router's 192 \nip. The router does not allow editing dns. I think this is due to using \ndhcp. Is there an alternative which wouldn't cause a default to the router's \ndns? Any pointers appreciated. \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
