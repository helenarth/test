If he can \nonly receive e-mails from fellow Cubans, then even if there are fellow \nCubans who could help him and are subscribed to the list, they will never \nreceive his posts, since the list server is outside of Cuba. In fact, \nno-one in Cuba could even subscribe to the list, since they will never \nreceive the confirmation e-mail. And if they don't have web access \neither, then posting to *any* list is an exercise in futility for Cubans. \nLists are black holes to Cubans. Everything goes in, nothing comes out. \nApparently he hasn't figured that out yet. \n \n-- \n .''`.
