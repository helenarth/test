I'm still using kmail/kontact/etc. (basically kdepim) from 4.3 since I \nhave no desire to run yet another RDBMS on my system. (I already run \nPostgreSQL, and have a number of apps that use SQLite installed.) \n \nPlease don't force an \"Akonadi-enabled\" PIM suite on stable users before they \nare provided with an Akonadi that can use something other than MySQL. \n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr. ,= ,-_-. =. \nbss@iguanasuicide.net ((_/)o o(\\_)) \nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy `-'(. .)`-' \nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/ \\_/",
