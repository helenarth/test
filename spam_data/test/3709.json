I only use headless and Xless boxes so I have not \nlooked into whether the kernel uses grub2's GRUB_GFXMODE OR \nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX variables to set the video mode. KMS can be \nturned off in grub.cfg with either \"nomodeset\" (possibly superceded) \nor \" .modeset=0\" where video=i915|i945|nouveau|radeon... but I \nhave only gleaned this from reading Fedora and Ubuntu stuff. \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
