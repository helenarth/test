I have a 42U data center rack in my basement, and about \nhalf a dozen really old servers. They aren't really worth much from a \nfinancial standpoint, but at the same time, I use them as a sort of test \nlab. and I have a Tripp Lite 1000VA and an APC BackUPS 1000 (just replaced \nthe batteries) in the rack. I also have a BackUPS 350 for my workstation. \n \nIt's not about the cost of the hardware (as I said, almost everything is 32 \nbit PIII/P4 class hardware that has little to no value in most business \nenvironments (which is how I came by it, by and large), but my data?
