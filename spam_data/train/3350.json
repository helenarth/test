They will be Extremely Qualified due to the nature of the \nqualifying questions that will be asked (above). \n2. They are Super-Fresh!  Delivered in Real-Time only moments \nafter they are contacted and qualified!  (Not 30-120 days old) \n3. They're Targeted.  Each Lead we generate originates from a \ntargeted list of business opportunity seekers. \n4. They're Highly Receptive!  Receptivity is very, very high \nbecause they aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching \nthem on opportunities!  Also they'll remember speaking to \nsomeone over the phone.  Especially since we tell them to \nexpect your call! \n5. No \"feast or famine\" activity.  Leads will be coming in \nregularly.  You dictate the flow! \n6. No more cold calls!  We tell your prospects you'll be calling. \n7. You can *personalize* your approach with the info. you \nget with each Lead! \n8. Save Time.  Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale. \n9. Lower \"burnout\" factor.  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier \nto pick up the phone, day in and day out. \n10. You can sort your Leads based on their responses and call the \nhottest ones first. \n11. You can get new reps started quicker using these Leads due \nto higher closing ratios.  Of course, this builds faster and stronger \nmomentum, and skyrockets \"new rep retention\" as a result of \n\"quick successes\". \n12. The Leads will be uniform - almost all leads will have the info. \nindicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.) \n13.
