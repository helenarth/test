    "body": "xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxX Thank you for your interest! \n \nJudgment Courses offers an extensive training \ncourse in \"How to Collect MoneyJudgments\" \n \nIf you are like many people, you are not even sure what a \nMoney Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments \ncan earn you very substantial income . \n \nIf you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you \nwill have a Money Judgment against them. \n \nYou are happy you won but you will soon find out the \nshocking fact: \"Its now up to you to collect on the \nJudgment\". The court does not require the loser to pay you. \nThe court will not even help you. You must trace the loser \ndown, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts, \nreal estate, stocks and bonds, etc. \n \nVery few people know how to find these assets or what to do \nwhen they are found. The result is that millions of \nJudgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten. \n \n\"In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a \ndime.\" \n \nThe non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic \nproportions. Right now in the United States there is \nbetween 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney \nJudgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more \nJudgments take its place. \n \nWe identified this massive market 8 years ago and have \nactively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this \nbusiness. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid \nprofession in which only a select few will be trained in the \ntechniques necessary to succeed. \n \nWith our first hand experience we have built a course which \nteaches you how to start your business in this new unknown \nand exciting field of processing Money Judgments. \n \nBy following the steps laid out in our course and with \nreasonable effort you can become very successful in the \nprocessing of Money Judgments. \n \nThe income potential is substantial in this profession. We \nhave associates who have taken our course and are now \nworking full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per \nyear. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00 \nand $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of \ntheir home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable \norganization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business \noffices. \n \nToday our company and our associates have over 126 \nmillion dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently \nprocessing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form \nof joint ventures between our firm and our associates. \nJoint ventures are where we make our money. We only break \neven when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on \nthe reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting \ncapability is so extensive that government agencies, police \nofficers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us \nfor reports. \n \n \nMany of our associates already have real estate liens in \nforce of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars. \nLegally this means that when the properties are sold or \nrefinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10% \ninterest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments. \nAnnual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to \n$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the \npayment of the principal. \n \nOur associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per \nyear. This is just for interest, not counting principle \nand not counting the compounding of the interest which can \nadd substantial additional income. Typically companies are \nsold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest \nan associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell \ntheir business for approximately 2.5 million dollars. \n \n92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43% \nare women and 36% are part time . \n \nOne of the benefits of working in this field is that you are \nnot under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off \nfor a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are \nworking on will be there when you return. The Judgments \nare still in force, they do not disappear. \n \nThe way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your \ncomputer and telephone to do most of the processing. You \nnever confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you \nare. You are not a collection agency. \n \nSimply stated the steps to successful Money Processing \nare as follows: \n \nMail our recommended letter to companies and individuals \nwith Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who \nto write to) \n \n8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you \nand ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them \nunless you want to. \n \nYou send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to \nsign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and \n50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for \n$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00. \n \nYou then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor \nand their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to \nassist you. They range from credit reports from all three \ncredit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment \nlocates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc. \nThe prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to \n1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge \n$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other \ncompanies charge $25.00. \n \nOnce you find the debtor and their assets you file \ngarnishments and liens on the assets you have located. \n(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the \ncourse) \n \nWhen you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to \nthe original Judgment holder. \n \nOnce the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of \nJudgment to the court. (Included in the course) \n \nQuote's from several of our students: \n \nThomas in area code 516 writes us: \"I just wanted to drop \nyou a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My \nfirst week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your \nprofessionalism in both the manual and your support. \nYou have the video opened doors for me in the future. \nThere's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states \nhe has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on\" \n \nAfter only having this course for four months, Larry S. in \narea code 314 stated to us: \"I am now making $2,000.00 per \nweek and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the \nnext year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in \njudgments I am collecting on now\" \n \nAfter having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated \n\"I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately \n$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I \nwill have to hire someone to help out\" \n \nMarshal in area code 407 states to us \"I feel bad, you only \ncharged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I \nhave added 3 full time people to help me after only having \nyour course for 5 months\" \n \n>From the above information and actual results you can see \nwhy we can state the following: \n \nWith our course you can own your own successful business. \nA business which earns you substantial income now and one \nwhich could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to \nretire on and travel the world. A business which is \nextremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every \nday is new and exciting. \n \nNone of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is \nChallenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate \nDownsizing. A business which you can start part time from \nyour home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full \ntime.
