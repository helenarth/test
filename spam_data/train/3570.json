    "body": "Hi, \nsince this seems to be the time to complain about KDE, I'd like to ask for \nhelp on an old issue: kded4 prevent the plasma weather applets from working. \nWhen I login to my KDE session the weather applets fail to retrieve any data. \nI've confirmed with Wireshark/TCPdump that there is no network traffic at that \ntime. As soon as I kill kded4 the weather applets startk working immedeately. \nIs there are another workaround than killing kded4 (since that messes up some \nother things in KDE) or, even better, a fix available? \n \n-- \nMit freundlichen Grüßen / Best Regards \nDominik",
