I don't see \nthis as possible however. How is dpkg to know that the libc6 upgrade is not \nfor security patches or point release? I suppose something could be put in \nplace so that the security repo is treated differently. \n \nThe best way to avoid this: Don't mix releases. When necessary, its \ngenerally safer to build the source packages. You will also realize how far \nyou are digging into testing when you start needing to backport libs. \n \nThis is potentially reversible, but you should know in the future that core \npackages such as libc6, perl, python, and etc should never be mixed between \nreleases. \n \nI have no advice for fixing the current issue... Only avoiding it in the \nfuture. \n \n-- \nJordan Metzmeier",
