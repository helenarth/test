In some cases, resizing the frame solved the issue. \n2. In few cases, changed the location of one of the component present inside \nthe frame and then relocating the same component to its original position at \nthe end of the method solved the problem. \n3. In one case, removed the component and added the same component to the \nframe solved the issue. \n \nAnother typical point to note is, I could not find a single common solution \nfor all the above 3 cases. \n \nRegards, \nVPKVL \n \n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"hoverfrog\" \nTo: \"Vijay Kachhawal\" \nSent: Friday, May 14, 2010 03:44 PM \nSubject: Re: Snow Leopard refresh problems \n \n \nhello, \n \ndid you find any workarounds? \nAre some methods of asking for a repaint more reliable than others? \n \nregards, \n \nMary \n \nLe 14 May , 2010 à 7:55 AM, Vijay Kachhawal a écrit : \n \n> I have also experienced similar problem in many cases.
