We have 4 regular volunteers \nand currently having a different member each month volunteering to do \na presentation. Only occasionally having an outside speaker. \nSometimes via iChat. \n \nWhen I was with HAUS in Honolulu, we thanked the volunteers by buying \nthem pizza each month at the board meetings. In Boston, we had an \nannual meeting of \"activists\". 400 strong. Then we had an annual \npicnic for volunteers as well. \n \nI think it never hurts to thank people every chance you can get. \n \nLynn \n \n \n\"Sometimes I wonder whether the world is being run by smart people who \nare putting us on or by imbeciles who really mean it.\" --Mark Twain \n \nLynn Wegley \nlynnw3@csmining.org \nhttp://www.ugnn.com \n \nOn Apr 30, 2010, at 12:38 AM, Nicholas Pyers wrote: \n \n> Here in Australia, May 10th to 16th, 2010 is National Volunteer Week \n> (NVW) â€“ the largest celebration of volunteers and volunteerism in \n> Australia, and it provides an opportunity to highlight the role of \n> volunteers in our communities and to say thank you to the more than \n> 5 million Australians who volunteer. \n> \n> Earlier this week I asked Australian Apple User Groups if they were \n> doing anything to thank their volunteers, and in light of Chris \n> Hart's query about ways of getting people onto Boards & Committees \n> and my response about thanking outgoing Committee members, I thought \n> now would also be an appropriate time to share the article with \n> everyone here. \n> \n> The article provides some ideas on WHO to thank; HOW to thank them; \n> and WHEN it may be appropriate to thank them. \n> \n> You can read the article over at; \n> http://www.appleusers.org/ugr/have-you-thanked-your-volunteers/ \n> \n> If your group has done something different or interesting to thank a \n> member of your group, perhaps you'll share the idea with the list :) \n> \n> -- \n> Nicholas Pyers (nicholas@appleusers.org) \n> Founder & Publisher, AppleUsers.org \n> \n> http://www.appleusers.org/ \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> _______________________________________________ \n> Do not post admin requests to the list.
