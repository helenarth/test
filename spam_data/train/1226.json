They \nmight tell us why your filesystem is not getting cleanly re-mounted read-only. \n \n> > I also have 4+ tebibytes but most of them are allocated to filesystems. \n> > I've \n> > had to shrink filesystems dozens of times since 2005, during or after a \n> > data \n> > move. \n> \n> I've had to extend on the fly many more times than I have had to reduce. \n \nYes. Many, many more times. A filesystem that can't grow is beyond useless \nfor me. Luckily btrfs support growing and shrinking and it can do both while \nmounted. On-line shrinking is a trick I couldn't get reiser3 to perform. \n \n> > I'm hoping to be able to move that onto LVM once I move to \n> > GRUB2 and GPT. \n> \n> You know, /boot on bare drive has never bothered me, especially since I use \n> encrypted filesystems on everything but VMs. On laptops, I had it set up so \n> /boot lived on a thumb drive...So I'm cool with it. \n \nWell, I will still have to have a \"partition\" for GRUB to embed stage 1.5 if I \ngo with GPT. However, it won't contain files per se. I like having as much \nas possible on LVM because it makes it easier to migrate to new storage media \nand retire the old media. \n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr. ,= ,-_-. =. \nbss@iguanasuicide.net ((_/)o o(\\_)) \nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy `-'(. .)`-' \nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/ \\_/",
