If untrusted strangers\nare relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that\nyou've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create\nan rcpthosts file or something).\n\nAnyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I\nwould suggest tossing qmail-scanner \nand SpamAssassin into the mix as well.\nThe former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter\ndoes its work (including razor-check invocations).\n\nFair warning: It'll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying\nrelaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust. To find\nout how to do that, go to (which, incidentally,\nshould be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for \"qmail\nnewbie's guide to relaying\".\n\n- Adrian\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board\nfor high-tech professionals.
