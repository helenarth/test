(the loss of the ability to have a \ndifferent background for each desktop was a KDE showstopper. So the \nforced downgrade prompted me to actually take a serious look at other \ndesktop environments. And had that not happened, I would not be \nusing Enlightenment on all my Linux boxes today. I have become quite \nenamored with Enlightenment, and now see no need whatsoever to go back \nto KDE or switch to Gnome. \n \nGranted, I will happily use various KDE and Gnome based tools if \nneeded. That is no big deal. But E (with the Steampunk theme) is \nnow my environment of choice. :) Only drawback so far I have \nencountered is the inability to change the background color on the \ndesktop if the wallpaper image does not fill the entire screen. It \ncan be a bit hard on the eyes with that harsh white background, but I \nthink I can get used to it. \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
