If you already know the name (or have \nguessed it) of a file in the directory and you have \"--x\" (no-read, no- \nwrite, yes-search) on the directory and 'r--' (read-only) on the file, \nyou can read the file even though you can't read the directory. \nThat's a feature, and it dates back to early days in UNIX. \n \nWhat you are seeing is a corner case caused by that feature. If you \nhave \"r--\" on the directory you can read it, but you can't find any of \nthe files whose names you can read. So you can't get those files \npermission bits or mod-time's etc. So \"ls\" fails in the bizarre way \nyou are seeing. \n \nSo you can \"read\" the directory without the \"x\" bit, but it doesn't do \nyou a fat load of good. \n \nEnjoy! \n \nRick \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
