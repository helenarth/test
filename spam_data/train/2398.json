Keep the bad guys out of your PC or network with the advanced technology that's trusted by millions: ZoneAlarm Pro 3.0. This best-in-class personal firewall stops hackers cold, defends your online privacy,and sets up in minutes. Click here to download now!\n\n\n\nWell, it's been half a week since we released it, and we're still\ngetting record downloads for our first\nFREE Gnometome. What does\nthat mean? Simple. Download all you want - we'll definitely make\nmore. In fact, we've found a way to get your products and services\na little bit of unlimited promotion on the side, too. And who\ncouldn't use a little more traffic nowadays? Well, unless your\ndata transfer bill is already sky high (which can happen when you\nget featured). It's all fun and games until someone's server falls\nto its knees. We're still sitting\nat #5 on Amazon. If we ever\nhit #1, I'll eat my hat. And, mind you, this hat has been sitting\naround for quite a while; it smells like feet. You'd have to eat\nthree sombreros just to get the same amount of nutrition you'd get\nfrom my hat. You're better off just going for the free stuff, I\nsuppose. The next time they ask: \"Do you care to Super Size that?\"\nYou can respond, with dignity: \"My funds are sufficient for the\nupgrade; I avoided spending money on something that would have\nlasted longer, supported a helpful cause, and not have killed me\nearlier.\" It makes sense - if you think about it. The fries aren't\ngoing to eat themselves. And if YOU don't eat the fries, who will?\n\n \n\nPut your hunger aside for just a moment. It's time for a paragraph\nI like to call: \"Why you shouldn't sign up for DirectDSL.\" They\nwent out of their way to send me an unsolicited e-mail this\nevening. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"How kind of them,\nChris. You were just asking about DSL providers in yesterday's\nissue. They must have read your mind!\" No, they must have rented a\nlist of addresses which weren't confirmed. But the fun didn't stop\nthere. I received a message about DirectTV from yet ANOTHER\nmarketing company. Their effort was indeed caught by this crafty\neye, and my money will be diverted to other (less-spammish)\nbusinesses in the future. It's my \"direct\" way of saying: you're\nnot the only game in town. Anybody else care to test my patience?\nI didn't think so. My blacklist gets shared with 250,000 people\nfrom around the world. Oops! My Inbox just got slammed with more\njunk; looks like Lycos will never get another click from me,\neither. See what you get when you tempt fate?\n\n \n\nMy good buddy, Bill,\ntells me that Speakeasy.net\nprovides great DSL connections. He'll even get the credit if I\nsign up through his affiliate link! Paul Howes agrees with him,\ntoo: \"Static IPs are the norm, they do not use PPPoE, and they\nencourage people to run servers on their DSL connection. When\nlooking at their packages, I suggest you look at the 'Home\nServices' page. They even have ADSL up to 1.5M downstream / 768k\nupstream, which I have not seen from any other provider. And that\nis less than $200 a month, which is a bargain when you start\nlooking at the prices of a 768k SDSL line!\" And Stuart Portner is\nchock full of common sense: \"Remember that a lot of DSL providers\ngive you the modem for free and prefer that you use theirs - at\nleast for initial setup / shakedown period.\" All the more fries\nfor me, dude!\n\n\n\n\n See You in August,               Chris Pirillo       \n\n  GnomeCONFERENCE \n $99 Pre-Registration / $150 At The Door\n\n  GnomeDOWNLOADS \n \n Today's Downloads \nAppPlus 3.24 \nEaseBackup 3.70 \nHotCrypt 4.12 \nArles Image Web Pa 4.94 \nSmasher 2.9.12 \nThe Bat! 1.61 \nWinSafe 1.1.2 \nPrivacy Eraser 1.68 \nZero Popup 3.0 \nWinPulse 1.01 \n\n\nCompany Overview v1.3 [389k] W9x/2k/XP FREE\n \nhttp://www.toteboard.net/Models/company_overview.htm\n \n\n{Check your stocks} When you're doing long-term investing, the\nbest thing to do with your money is to invest and then \"forget\nabout it.\" Our Gnomie buddy Brian Stevens is the type of guy that\nlikes to play the stock market. He's always logging into E*TRADE\nand checking on his stocks. That's a lot of work! We told him to\nforget about it and let Company Overview do the work. This Excel\nspreadsheet and add-in is a great way to check stocks and save the\ndata into a separate Excel spreadsheet. Brian says, \"E*TRADE\ndoesn't give me half the information that Company Overview does,\nsuch as insider trades and financial trends, along with many other\ntidbits of information.\" NOTE: You must use Excel 2000 or higher\nfor the spreadsheet to operate correctly.\n\n \n\nFlexible Renamer v5.2.0 [426k] W9x/2k/XP FREE\n \nhttp://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014830/english/FlexRena/\n \n\n{Rename your files} I work with a lot of files throughout the day,\nand sometimes I end up with a desktop cluttered with useless\ncopies and shortcuts - and you KNOW how I feel about clutter. I\ndon't need a reminder that there are five shortcuts or six copies\nof something on my desktop... and that is where Flexible Renamer\ncomes into the picture. With Flexible Renamer, I can cut off the\n\"Shortcut to\" and \"Copy of\" prefixes from all my files, making\nthem a lot easier to read. That's not all though... you can even\nmake a .txt file on your desktop into a .doc document in seconds.\nIf you don't like your filename in all caps, then just switch them\nto lower case and vice-versa. The possibilities are endless! (You\nknow, I always wanted to change my own name from \"Chris\" to\n\"Caspian Wildflowers\"...)\n\n\n\n\n\n Recommend It!\n  GnomeCLICKS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n  GnomeSYSTEM \n\nDisk Investigator v1.1 [527k] W9x/2k/XP FREE\n \nhttp://www.theabsolute.net/sware/dskinv.html\n \n\n{Restore deleted files} Have you ever deleted a file from your PC,\nrealizing later that you actually needed it? Yeah, me too. Best-\ncase scenario, I would just go to the Recycle Bin and retrieve my\ndeleted file. But what if I had already emptied the Recycle Bin?\n(Horrors!) Luckily, Disk Investigator can come into play and save\nthe day. (Yay!) With Disk Investigator, I can view deleted files\nor directories, and restore them if necessary. I no longer have to\nwonder if I fully deleted a troublesome file... I just load up\nDisk Investigator, and I'll know if the file is gone (with 100%\ncertainty)!\n\n\n\n\n Recommend It!\n  GnomeWILDCARD \n\nActual Title Buttons 1.3 [1.0M] W9x/2k/XP $19.95 \n Unearthed by Michael Tretyakov\n \nhttp://www.actualtools.com/\n \n\n{Windows Explorer add-on} \"Actual Title Buttons lets you add the\nnew Minimize To Tray and Stay On Top buttons to any program's\ntitle bar next to the Windows standard Minimize/Maximize/Close\nbuttons.\" This program is a must for anyone who wants to avoid the\ndistractions of other windows popping up over your active windows.\nWhile writing this review, I am using the \"Stay On Top\" command\nfor Notepad, and during this time I have already received five\ninstant messages. Why is this important? Normally these messages\nwould pop up in front of Notepad and disrupt my work... but with\nActual Title Buttons, I can keep typing without missing those\n\"important\" instant messages. The only difference is that they\naren't an annoyance now. The \"Minimize To Tray\" feature is great,\ntoo, because freeing up taskbar space is a beautiful thing...\nespecially when you don't have to close down your programs to do\nit.\n\n\n\n\n Submit Your Thoughts | Recommend It!\n  GnomeFAVORITE \n \nWE NEED YOU TO BE AT GNOMEDEX!

All the action on this website is based\naround a city block of Electriconland. You walk into different\nstores to get different pixel art icons. Walk into Gabu's Pub and\nyou will find icons in the likeness of Pink Floyd. You won't be\ndisappointed when you go around the corner and pick up your\nAvengers icons from the comic store. If all this wasn't good\nenough then maybe this fact alone will send you to the street of\nElectriconland... all the icons are cross platform. This means you\ncan have your new favorite icons on your Windows, Mac, and Linux\nmachine, or maybe even a different one on each. The possibilities\nare endless!\n\n\n\n\n\n Recommend It!\n  GnomeTIP \n\nI just hate it when I try to install a program and the\ninstallation fails. I hate it even more when the program doesn't\nleave a log file to help me track down the problem. Some would say\nI am out of luck, but as long as the program uses Windows\nInstaller, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because for\nany program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging\nthrough the Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\ Software \\\nPolicies \\ Microsoft \\ Windows \\ Installer. Add a new String\nvalue, double-click it, and enter the following Value data:\n\"voicewarmup\" (sans quotes). These letters can be entered in any\norder: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i =\nStatus messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error\nmessages; w = Non-fatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r =\nAction-specific records; m = Out-of- memory or fatal exit\ninformation; u = User requests; p = Terminal properties. If you\nadd a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add an\nexclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails,\nI just have to check in the \"Temp\" directory and look for my log\nfiles. They'll vary in name, but will always start with \"Msi\" and\nend with the .LOG extension. As always, make sure to backup your\nregistry before making any modifications.\n\n\n\n\n Recommend It!\n\n \n \n\nhttp://www.lockergnome.com/issues/daily/20020716.html\n Your subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@spamassassin.taint.org] - To unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page.
