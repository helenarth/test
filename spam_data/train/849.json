Maybe you need to polish \nyour \nWeb design skills? Get full-length books from the Poor Richard's \nseries, including Poor Richard's E-mail Publishing, by Chris Pirillo, at GnomeTomes.com, for 50% off the suggested retail price of the print versions. \nClick here to learn more. \n\nI'm now twice a published author. Earlier in the week, I released my \ntop 50 Mac OS X tips, \nwhich marks the only thing I've ever written that I \nexpect anyone to pay for. If you happen to use OS X, go check them out. \nMy second publication is a PDF only explanation of the process for \nconverting Vinyl LPs to CD, by way of your PC (how's that for alphabet \nsoup). For the time being, you can get it absolutely free, with the \ncaveat that I'd appreciate some feed back on what could be added to make \nit more useful (I'm considering some screen shots for it if I get some \ntime). What are you waiting for -- \nget something free already.\n \nWith the expiration of Lockergnome's old cell phone plan, Lori and I \nopted to make a switch to Verizon, at the recommendation of Brian \nStevens. I'm already happy with the suggestion, as our previous provider \nhad horrid customer service, not to mention I now have a much geekier \nphone in the form of the \nKyocera QCP 6035 \nPalm powered unit. It's just \nlarger than most Palm devices on the market, but having the device \nintegration is nice. It has all the functionality of a Palm, with some \nInternet browsing capabilities and of course, phone access. A built in \nspeakerphone actually works better than I expected, Now all I need to \ndo is get more applications installed.\n \nOf interest to anyone who signed up for \nemusic after Chris and I talked \nthe service up and down last week: It seems they've added in the ballpark \nof 1,000 Universal titles to their roster of offerings. Not surprising \nconsidering they're part of the same conglomerate, but still good news \nin terms of feature expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\n Jake Ludington        \n\n\n\n  GnomePRODUCER \nGIF Movie Gear v3.02 [1129k] W9X/NT/W2K/XP $40 \n\nhttp://www.moviegear.com/gmgdet.htm \n\n\nThe majority of GIF animation on the Web does absolutely nothing for \nme. I'm of the mindset that animation is meant to either tell a story \nor illustrate a concept -- not put something in motion just because \nyou can. That said, for anyone wanting to create animations, this tool \nmakes it nice and easy. A storyboard interface keeps you thinking like \na movie maker as you build your animated creations, which lends itself \nto helping anyone who'd like to get from point A to point B in an \norderly fashion. The software supports PSD, JPG, AVI, BMP, and GIF \nformats, leaving your options open for creating animated segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n  GnomeFEATURE \nMadshrimps Extreme CDROM Testing \n\nhttp://www.madshrimps.com/index-e.php?action=webnews-e&l1=0&l2=30 \n \nA little on the childish side, but this CD-Rom drive test is still very funny. \nWatch as this group rewrites the rules on drive benchmarking. If geek TV were \nmore like this, even non-geeks would tune in to watch (which probably says \nmore than it should about the lowest common denominator). A WMV capable player \nis required,.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  GnomeSKIN \n\n\n\n\nModular Orbb XP for S2 Remotes by Travelian \n\nPosted on 7/11/02 2:17PM --    \n \n \n \n\n[Download]\n\n -- [Zoom]\n -- [Visit DeskMod]\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  GnomeAUDIO \nLiquid Tension Experiment \nUnearthed by Jeff Orr \n\nhttp://www.yesiknow.com/lte/ \n\n\nFans of fusion guitar heroes, like Joe Satriani and Steve Vai, are going to \ndig this collection of talented players.

John Cusack and Tim Robbins \nmake this comedy work, starring as the two security guards as they \nsend up all sorts of Hollywood stereotypes. You can't help but laugh \nat the ridiculous predicaments these two survive, as they are \ngreeted with cameos by a who's who of music and movie industry names. \nI'm sure neither Robbins nor Cusack would openly list this movie on a \nresume, but it is indeed a brilliant performance by both of them, \nespecially as a demonstration of their ability to play off of each \nother. Although this is a late 80's release (one of the few 80's \nunderground classics I hadn't previously seen), it remains relevant \nto those out there who are looking to put it to the man. If you've \never hated the recording industry and its in-crowd attitude, you'll \nlove this film. A closing reference to Rene's Courtyard Cafe in Santa \nMonica, which is a regular stop for me every time I'm in the LA area, \nprompted me to want to watch the film for a second viewing. The movie \nis humorous enough for several viewings. Nothing really grabs attention \non the DVD, but then again, the studio probably expects no one will buy \nit anyway.\n\n\n \n\n \n Region 1 Encoding (US and Canada only)\n Color, Closed Captioned, Widescreen\n Sound: Dolby Digital 5.1 (English)\n Audio Commentary - Bill Fishman - Director, Michael Nesmith - Executive Producer, Catherine Hardwicke - Production Designer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  GnomeWALLPAPER \n\n\n\n\nA N N I H I L A T I O N for Abstract by prelude \n\nPosted on 7/11/02 2:15PM --    \n \n \n \n\n[Download]\n\n -- [Zoom]\n -- [Visit DeskMod]\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n\nhttp://www.lockergnome.com/issues/digitalmedia/20020710.html \n Your subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@spamassassin.taint.org] - To unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page.
