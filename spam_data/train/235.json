This was a server installed by some body else. \n \nThe folder limit was reached some time back. \n \nAs a temporary solution some directories were removed . \nThey will be fitting new drives tomorrow so I guess i will format them \nto XFS and use that. \n \nsince ext4 also has a limit ans jfs also has a limit of 64000 I guess \nI will use XFS which allows 2^32 directories under a directory. \n \nMy inclination to use JFS was because that is the file system that has \nproved stable for me during numerous crashes due to power failure back \nat home more than any other :-) \n \nThank you so much all of you for all the info. \n \n--Siju \n> Which file system can I use to over come it? \n> I am planning for JFS \n> \n> Does anybody has any recommendations? \n> \n> Thanks \n> \n> --Siju \n> \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
