    "body": "I'll always be slowly catching up on comp tech. \n \nI was using Knoppix and ClamAV to remove a virus for a friend when the \nfutility of it all hit me. The free anti-virus hopscotch game that windows \nusers play to feel safe. What wasted energy--over an OS I boot into maybe \n7% of the time. They screw up half the time. \n \nThere isn't a big demand for ClamAV on the Debian partitions of a \nlaptop/desktop. But I'll be scheduling scans of the XP partition from \nDebian. Doh! \n \nThere is even a ClamAV *win32* for the unlucky. \n \n-- \nKind Regards, \nFreeman \n \nhttp://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/ \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
