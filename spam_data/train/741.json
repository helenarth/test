Might as well \nmaximize your time with it. You'll find that some of these tips \nwill apply to other operating systems, too. The world of computing \nisn't so mysterious once you understand how it works. With this \nGnomeTome, you'll begin to work faster - and smarter. \nDownload Windows Productivity Tips now! \n\nI did a lot this weekend, but I didn't really get much done, \nya know? My knees are killing me from hauling stuff out of \nthe basement for storage up in the attic, but the pile only \nmade it as far as the kitchen. Then I stripped and painted \nthe floor where that collection of stuff was previously \nstored, and erected some shelving so I'd have room for more \nstuff. I woke up the next morning discover a very sick \nferret, likely from the fumes that leeched into the next \nroom over despite the ventilation I had setup to prevent the \nmigration of bad air. So, I ended up dismantling the ferret \ncage to move it upstairs for a week or so until I'm sure \nit's safe. Thankfully, all critters are doing well now.\n\n I also started in on replacing the cheapo rusted screws \nwith stainless steel deck screws out back, but found that \nthe ones I picked up are too weak, leaving me with stripped \nout heads and bent shafts. That project stopped after barely \ngetting started. The front steps are also in need of rust-\nproof screws, but they are made from much softer wood, so I \nmoved the tools to the other side of the house. Two-thirds \nof the way through the first row, I found that the extra \n1/2\" on the screws I purchased was too much and I began \nrunning into the top of the old concrete steps underneath. \nFigures. Live and learn. \n\n Oh well, it was entirely too hot to work outside anyway. \nBack down to the basement I went to geek out instead. \nRoughly an hour into geekitude, I glanced over and realized \nit was 78.7 degrees in the basement and I was virtually \nstuck to my chair from the sweat. I shut off as much as I \nreally could and still work on a couple of projects, but it \ndidn't help the heat situation much. It was just too hot \noutside for the air conditioner to keep up with the added \nheat from the computers. That left me in need of a shower \nand with only the notebook in the living room for the \nbalance of the weekend. I cleaned out a lot of ancient \nemail, which was nice, but nothing really got accomplished \notherwise. Boy, am I tired. And the weekend is so far away.\n\n Hey, the second season of M*A*S*H comes out on DVD \ntomorrow! That should put me in better spirits. I could \nwatch M*A*S*H for hours on end. In fact, I often do just \nthat. The only kink is that the episodes don't play back-to-back \nfrom DVD. I'm going to play with AppleScript on the Mac \nto see if I can customize how the individual discs play. In \ntheory, I should be able to make a disc play all the way \nthrough. If I succeed, I'll be sure to share the script \ntechnique in the AppleCore newsletter. Too bad I can't do that with a stand-alone DVD player.\n\n See You in August,               Randy Nieland       \n\n\n\n  GnomeNETWORK \n\nSlow File Save Dialog Boxes\n Pointed out by Ian Hargreaves\n\n http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q321126\n\n I've hated this one for a long time, and now we have a \nhotfix and a workaround, so take your pick as to which will \nwork best. I often map drive letters to specific network \nshares, and if I happen to have a system turned off, I'll \nnotice a significant delay when clicking the drop-down boxes \nin Open, Look In or Save In/As dialog boxes. Windows 2000 \nattempts to reconnect to mapped resources before showing you \nthe list, and depending on how many drives you have mapped \nand how many of those resources are unavailable, it can take \neons just to save a file. A workaround is to use the My \nNetwork Places functionality instead of mapping drive \nletters. Fine for some, but I prefer having drive letters \nmapped for many things, being that I work at a command \nprompt quite a bit, and it's easier to navigate that way. \nAlternatively, a hotfix is now available, but you'll have to \ncontact Microsoft to obtain the fix if that's the route you \nchoose.\n\n\n  GnomeSYSTEM \n\nCustomized 9x/ME Blue Screen Errors\n\n http://www.vsres.com/blscrn/\n\n We've all seen 'em. Those annoyingly incoherent blue \nscreens indicating a system error of some sort, but provide \nno real help in solving the problem. If you're a programmer \nthat has had to deal with error conditions produced by \nWindows 95/98/ME, then this might be a better way to handle \nthem within your applications. Blue Screen v1.21 is an \nActiveX control that uses the standard Windows system error \nfunctions, but provides a way to pass along text and \nresponse options you designate. Note that this is not \nfunctional on Windows NT/2000/XP, which handle system errors \nin an entirely different manner.\n\n Gamers Beware of Intel 845G Chipset\n\n http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4532\n http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4513\n\n Discount the AMD hype and returned volley from Intel when \nreading up on all of this, but one thing is painfully clear. \nThe Intel 845G chipset and P4 Celeron processors really \ndon't provide an acceptable gaming experience. Not only is \nperformance subject to ridicule, but compatibility is also \nlooking to be a serious matter. Intel has never claimed that \nCelerons were high-end desktop processors, but they have \ntypically provided a decent enough experience that they can \nmake for acceptable machines for the more budget-minded \nconsumer. The compatibility issues with this particular \nversion of Celeron and the 845G chipset are something to \nwatch out for. Once the Celeron is moved to the .13 micron \ncore, I suspect the performance concern won't remain, but \nthe 845G alone seems to have it's own problems without \nadding the Celeron misery. The lesson in knowing what \nhardware you're buying is what's important here.\n\n\n\n  GnomeALERTZ \n\nToday's Top 5 kbAlertz\n\n \n\n Q296133 - WD2002: Recorded Macro to Create Right-to-Left Style Records Paragraph Alignment Incorrectly (Q296133)\n\n Q292152 - WD2002: Macro to Modify Currently Selected Text Does Not Work Correctly (Q292152)\n\n Q292150 - WD2002: Undo Command Does Not Remove List Style Link to Paragraph Style (Q292150)\n\n Q292094 - WD2002: Error Message: Microsoft Mail Local Fax Is Not Installed on Your System (Q292094)\n\n Q292078 - WD2002: New Document Created by Macro While Word Is Minimized Opens in Restored State (Q292078)\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCLEAN YOUR SYSTEM Add/Remove Plus! 2002 offers a new and better way \nto uninstall programs you no longer want on your computer. All you have to do \nis double-click on a Desktop icon called \"Uninstall Programs\", quickly find \nthe program you want to uninstall and click a button. Add/Remove Plus! 2002, \nunlike the standard Windows uninstall feature (the Control Panel Add/Remove \nPrograms applet), will uninstall the program and remove it from the list. \nGet Your Copy of Add/Remove Plus Now!\n\n\n\n Recommend It!\n  GnomeASSISTANT \n\nTest Drive Compaq Servers\n\n http://www.testdrive.compaq.com/\n\n Compaq (Ok, HP) offers a set of servers running various \n*nix operating systems, as well as Oracle 9i, for test \ndrive. Just register for an account and you can tinker \naround with Linux, FreeBSD or even Tru64 Unix running on an \nAlpha server, but without the hassle and expense of \nobtaining your own toys. I love the idea of having a pre-\nconfigured environment that lets you kick the tires without \ncausing any permanent damage. \n\n\n  GnomeSTUFF \n\nToo Cool\n\n http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,102779,00.asp\n\n This was just too interesting not to mention. Water-cooled \nsystems are all-the-rage among overclockers and those \nthat seem to need bragging rights over their friends' computer \nsystems. Hitachi is taking a chapter from that tome and \napplying the concept where it's truly needed - notebook \ncomputers. Believe me when I say that these suckers get very \nhot. I spend half my life with notebook planted on lap, and \nI have to put something between the two surfaces to avoid my \nown little heat stroke. Fans and the mini water cooling \nsystem Hitachi is implementing provide roughly the same heat \nmitigation efficiency, but without the noise. The concept of \na water-cooled notebook sounds a little odd, but I would \nwelcome the elimination of the turbine droning with open \narms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recommend It!\n \n \n\nhttp://www.lockergnome.com/issues/techspecialist/20020722.html\n Your subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@spamassassin.taint.org] - To unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page.
