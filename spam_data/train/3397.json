Find your\nIT talent \nsolution\ntoday!\n\nI don't usually spend much time explaining metaphors. They are, after all, \nmetaphorical. They can be filled with whatever symbolism you choose. Written \nwell, we all come to some similar understanding of their meaning. But, I'll \ndepart today, contrary to my normal practice, to take a few minutes explaining a \n\n\n\n\nrecent metaphor. \n\nI'm a Linux guy through and through. As a user, I see myself as right about at \nthe average on the curve. For love of the language and open source attitude, \nthough, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone with quite the same level of \nenthusiasm. Put simply, there's very little about the Linux and broader open \nsource worlds that I don't like or believe in. \n\nTake, for example, the practice of recursive acronyms. GNU (\"Gnu's Not Unix\"), \nHURD (\"Herd of Unix-Replacing Daemons\"), WINE (\"Wine Is Not an Emulator\"), even \nPHP (\"PHP Hypertext Processor\") - all carry on the tradition of recursion in the \n\n\n\n\nUnix/Linux world. Goofy as it sounds, I love this stuff. \n\nSo it is that I set out to create a recursive metaphor last week. It could only \nhave happened on or about the 4th of July. In fact, it happened in the edition \nof the 3rd. I wrote a piece about how we Americans spend more time over the \ncourse of a year talking about what's wrong with our system than what's \nright. I wrote it knowing full well that many of the responses I'd get would be \na) from readers outside the US and b) in sharp disagreement to my comments or \nthose of citizens of other countries. You're following me, right? People would \ndisagree with an article that said we spend much time disagreeing. This, of \ncourse, would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical way - the perfect \nrecursive metaphor. The point was to be made yet more perfectly by the eventual \ninclusion in Penguin Shell of the comments of someone from outside the US \n\n\n\n\ndisagreeing with my take our argumentativeness as Americans. Ideally, they would \n\n\n\n\nbe comments that disagreed with our collective American perception of being \ndisagreeable. They would, of course, point out things about which citizens of \nother countries can disagree with Americans on. By exercising the right to \ndisagree, we'd subtly agree that we have that right. Yet another level of \nrecursion and a final layer of metaphor. \n\nThe response to both my own and Johan Sauviller's comments was overwhelming. In \nthe main, I believe both were appreciated. Many commented on the balance of the \ntwo pieces. Some readers were surprised, I think, to see a dissenting opinion \npublished so quickly, if at all. Overall, the ability to express honestly held \nopinions, to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the circle on the \nmetaphor in a perfect way. \n\nThings have, however, gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days. I'm not sure \nwhether some were slow in getting to the July 3rd issue, or whether it's just \nbeen stewing since then. Take, for instance, these comments by a reader who will \n\n\n\n\nremain mercifully nameless:\n\n \nWe get enough\nAmerica bashing from our left-wing whacko extremist press and schools here\nin the USA that we don't wish to hear some (insert favorite adjective here)\nfrom Belgium whining too!\n \n\nFollowed by:\n\n \n... please don't let Tony single-handedly tarnish the fine reputation\nof Lockergnome. I'm sure there are other articulate Linux experts out there who \nwould be able to replace him.\n \n\n... and, in a later note on the topic ...\n\n \nCensorship is to be encouraged in a\nfree-market society whenever and wherever it doesn't come from the\ngovernment.\n \n\nClearly, the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some. \n\nChris \n\n\n\n\nhas been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the editorial \npiece at the beginning of each newsletter. This particular piece is no \nexception. He's shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill \ncomments. While we all generally stay focused on technical issues, Chris has \nshown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are, in the end, humans \nwith opinions and thoughts to share. I think it's one of the things that makes \nthe Lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack - the personal touch. \n\nSo, despite the irrationality of some of this week's comments, I'll continue to \noccasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff. \n\nJust watch out. Recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye \nout. \n\n Tony\nSteidler-Dennison       \n\n\n  GnomeTWEAK \n\n \n\nLockergnome readers, SAVE 50% on the Computing Encyclopedia!\nAre you looking for the ultimate computing resource?

You've probably heard of both by now, as they've \ngarnered quite a bit of publicity both in and out of the Linux world. You'll \nrecall that I promised to try to secure copies for review this week. With the \nhelp of a friendly sales rep at CodeWeavers, I was able to accomplish that task \nthis morning. True to the second half of the promise, we'll spend the next few \ndays looking at these two products and how they might impact your Linux use. \nLet's take them in chronological order, starting today with CrossOver Plugin. \n\nA bit of background is in order. CodeWeavers is, in their own words, \" ... the \nleading corporate backer of the Wine Project. Wine has been, for the past several years, an \nongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux. It's a tough goal, but \nit's also one that's been undertaken by others in the past year or so. Though the progress has been \nslow, the Wine project has managed to stay at the front of this development \nrealm. \n\nCrossOver \nPlugin marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project. Prior to its \nrelease, Wine had taken a \"full system\" approach. Running Windows applications \nin Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no small amount of \nconfiguration work. CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from the system-wide \napproach to one that's much more modular. Rather than executing at system \nstartup, Wine is called as-needed, with the virtual Windows path to the called \nprogram. When the program is closed, so is Wine. CrossOver Plugin has focused on \n\n\n\ncreating Linux functionality with one related set of Windows \napplications: browser plugins. \n\nThe results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a \nsuccess. Off the top, CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime 5, Windows Media Player \n\n\n\n6.2, Shockwave 8.5, Flash 6, and RealPlayer 8 into a Linux-accesible browser \nplugin package. Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix, Trillian, Authorware Web \nPlayer 6 and eFax Messenger 2, and you've got virtually every need plugin need \ncovered. \n\nBut this package doesn't stop there. Included in the CrossOver Plugin package \nare viewers for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, as well as several \nMicrosoft-oriented fonts. Honestly, I was stunned at the range of applications \noffered by the CodeWeavers developers. \n\nHaving had some experience with Wine, I was a bit leery about the install \nprocess and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with \nmy RedHat setup. I've never been completely successful with Wine, but I hoped \nfor the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation. I really did want \n\n\n\nthese apps to work. \n\nThe installation was quite easy. By running the install-crossover.sh script from \n\n\n\nthe command line, I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver Plugin \n\n\n\nand CrossOver Office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. I started the plugin \ninstalls with QuickTime, a tool I've admittedly missed in Linux. In the \nbackground, CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C:\\ drive on my \nmachine. I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar sight \n\n\n\n- the Vise installer in its Windows format. CrossOver Plugin first checked for \nfeedback from the Windows binary, opened a virtual Windows window, then stepped \nout while the Vise installer took care of the rest. Though the install failed \nfour times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a failure of the \nCrossOver program. I kept \"retry\"ing and, with some persistence, managed to get \na full QuickTime 5 install downloaded from the Apple servers. Quite literally, \nthe install looked and performed exactly as I've seem many times in Windows. \nWhen the install was completed, CrossOver again checked for the Windows binary, \nlocated the appropriate .dll files in the virtual C:\\ drive and dropped the \nplugins into the /home/tony/.netscape/plugins and /home/tony/.mozilla/plugins \ndirectories. \n\nThe process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these \nbrowsers - \"Help\", \"About Plugins.\" Sure enough, the CrossOver QuickTime plugin \nwas listed. Quickly, I ran out to the Apple site and opened the \"Men In Black \nII\" movie trailer. QuickTime performed flawlessly. \n\nI followed with the Windows Media Player, Shockwave, Flash, IPix, and eFax \nMessenger installs. Of those, the only ones that weren't self-contained in the \nCrossOver install were IPix and eFax. Even at that, the installer pointed me to \nthe Windows download then found the .exe file when the download was done. Within \n\n\n\na half-hour, I had all installed and tested. \n\nThen, just for grins, I installed RealPlayer 8 via CrossOver. This was despite \nthe recommendation in the installer screen to use the Linux version. It went as \nsmoothly as the others with one caveat - the player played media files at a much \n\n\n\nfaster speed than that in Windows. Fast enough to make me laugh, in fact, \nreminded of Dave and Alvin the Chipmunk. Ah well, six out of seven is pretty \nstrong given my previous troubles with Wine. \n\nI also installed a few fonts - Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, and Veranda. \nIn every case, the install was quick and absolutely painless. \n\nWine has always held great promise. At times, it's been painful to watch the \ntedious pace of development, only because that promise was so alluring. With the \n\n\n\nbacking of CodeWeavers and a fundamental change in the approach to development, \nWine has finally realized the goal of integrating Windows applications \nseamlessly into the stable Linux environment. The results are so strong that, if \n\n\n\nI didn't know better, I'd swear that a few of these plugins actually run better \nin Linux than in their native Windows. Honestly, I didn't realize how much I \nmissed them until I started using them in Linux today. \n\nTomorrow holds a few surpirses, with a look at CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office \npackage. \n\n Recommend It! \nSend us a \nGnomeTWEAK\n\n\n  GnomeCORE \n\nKernel Configuration - Part IX \n\nWe're nine parts into the kernel configuration series, with quite a bit yet to \ngo. If you haven't been following along, we're breaking out the configuration \nscreens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and \nfunction of each. With that knowledge, you should be able to make a clear \ndecision as to how to configure each section. \n\nToday, it's the Parallel Port support section. This is pretty simple. If you \nneed parallel port support - such as for a printer - select this option either \nas a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module. \n\nMost will use the PC-style hardware option in conjuction with a Windows printer. \n\n\n\nBut that's not all the parallel port can be used for. As an example, the builds \nI did with the telescope company required parallel port support, as the \ntelescope cameras were attached to this port. \n\nBe aware - this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for \nthe parallel port. The computer's BIOS sets the mode for the port - ECP, EPP, or \n\n\n\nAuto. On the majority of modern computers, the Auto mode is the default and will \n\n\n\nwork just fine. However, if you have problems communicating with your printer \nfollowing a kernel recompile, try changing the mode of your printer in the \nBIOS. \n\nTomorrow, it's Plug and Play configuration. \n\n Recommend It! \nSend us a GnomeCORE \ntip\n\n\n\n  GnomeFILE \n\nNetics 2.0 \n\n \nhttp://www.citi.umich.edu/u/marius/netics/ \n\n\"Netics is an extensible network statistics collector. It puts the network \ninterface in promiscuous mode and reads the data stream (after it strips off the \n\n\n\nappropriate protocol headers), then displays the results at specified intervals, \n\n\n\neither in a \"progress bar\" mode or as raw statistics. Currently, it supports 2 \nstatistics, both involving entropy: LZW compressability and Ueli Maurer's \nuniversal statistical test. Maurer's test is a very good and comprehensive \nmeasure of entropy, but requires a large amount of data.
