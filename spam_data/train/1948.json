It's easy to use and install. \nThe guests OS that I tried and work: Debian, MEPIS, OpenSolaris, \nOpenSuse, Solaris 10, XP and some other Linux distros. DesktopBSD and \nFreeBSD work but can't get GUI -that can be lack of my knowledge. \n \nSame with open VirtualBox except I think that there is no USB support. \n \nAqemu (qemu) easy to use and install -DesktopBSD work's with GUI. \n \nI think that all VM have file sharing, printing depends on USB if you \nhave USB printer. \n \n-- \nBye, \nGoran Dobosevic \nHrvatski: www.dobosevic.com \n English: www.dobosevic.com/en/ \nRegistered Linux User #503414 \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
