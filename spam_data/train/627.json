(@Andrei: it was in the content of the file, sorry not to \nhave specified it before.) \n \nI am using the second command. The problem is that, for one set of \nfiles (that I have selected, no problem for this), I have to use a \nreally simple expression: I need to find all the occurences of \n`\\paragraph{}' and replace them with nothing (i.e. with `'). I know \nregexps, but replacing `$regexp' with `\\paragraph{}' gives error \nmessages. Any idea?
