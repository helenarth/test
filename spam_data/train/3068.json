It actually \nworks, and is documented, although it's still pretty much in the \nproof-of-concept stage: \n \nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/tmta/ \n \nOne important thing that it does *not* (yet?) do is fork; it's currently \nimplemented as a basic, single-threaded daemon, so it can only accept \none connection at a time. It shouldn't be too difficult (famous last \nwords ...) to convert into a multi-threaded model, although I have no \nexperience with that sort of thing. \n \nIt is still small, though - under 70 lines of actual Perl code, \nalthough it does, of course, require the basic Perl installation and \nabout a half-dozen other modules. \n \nIf anyone has any feedback, or suggestions for improvement, I'd love \nto hear them. \n \nCelejar \n-- \nfoffl.sourceforge.net - Feeds OFFLine, an offline RSS/Atom aggregator \nmailmin.sourceforge.net - remote access via secure (OpenPGP) email \nssuds.sourceforge.net - A Simple Sudoku Solver and Generator \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
