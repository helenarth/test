You need to follow the upgrade outline mentioned \nin the Release Notes. You didn't say how you did it, and it's too late \nin any case, but I just wanted to mention that while we're on the subject. \n \nAssuming that you did the migration properly, this may be a device name \nissue. There's been some problems with device names recently, particularly \nwith IDE hard disks. It hasn't happened to me, but others have reported \ndevice names going from /dev/hdx to /dev/sdx and back again with \nsubsequent maintenance. You may have to boot from a rescue disk, \nedit your /etc/fstab to change device names, according to what they \nare now, and rebuild your initial RAM file system. \n \nIf that is the issue, an alternative to traditional device names is \nto use UUIDs. \n \n-- \n .''`.
