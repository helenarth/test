Do you have trust in them? \n \n\"Linux, FreeBSD, OSX and other OSs\" all of them include their own \nlicencing model, whatever it is (closed or open sourced), so I can use \nthe software knowing beforehand what I can (or can't) do with it. \n \nThe licensing model of Flash was (very) unclear for me, that is what I \nmeant to say. And heck, it was recently \"opened\" (2008?) so it's a \nevolving license that could \"dissolve\" into something worse. \n \nDo not get me wrong, I'm only saying that if I were a developer, I would \nhave many doubts in choosing a flash format for any of my works. \n \nGreetings, \n \n-- \nCamaleón \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
