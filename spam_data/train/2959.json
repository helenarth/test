    "body": "> What I don't understand is why Ubuntu users *post* here, when they \n> actually run Ubuntu. \n \nI run Ubuntu and regularly read the Debian list, so maybe I can answer. \n \nIf I need to know where is the menus Firefox is, or how to change my \nwallpaper, the Ubuntu list is fine. But nobody there understands \n_anything_ about the OS. That is fine, the target audience of Ubuntu \nis not technical users. The barrier to entry is very low. My \n74-year-old mother in law uses Kubuntu. \n \nSo if the Debian support is so great, why do I run Ubuntu and not \nDebian? Several reasons. One, the low barrier to entry means that I \ncan get a system up and running in no time flat. Twice a year, 20 \nminutes and I've got the latest and greatest software versions. Debian \nstill needs tweaking for my problematic video card, and some other \nreally small details. But the biggest reason that I run Ubuntu is to \npromote it. I have done tens of installs for friends, neighbours, and \nfamily. I need to be familiar with what they are running. Debian just \nneeds a bit too much work, a bit too much handholding, and a bit too \nmuch explaining things. \n \nSo while my heart is with Debian, I run the best Debian derivative out there. \n \n \n-- \nDotan Cohen \n \nhttp://bido.com \nhttp://what-is-what.com \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
