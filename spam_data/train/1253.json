    "body": "Hiya \n \nI came across this blog \n \nhttp://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/want-it-give/ \n \nand I couldn't agree more with this person. \n \nBut I would like to bring this a little more home, and make it in the \nDebian sense. \nI would like to encourage more people to run Debian Testing, get more \ndebugging, but more importantly, please try and get involved. Submit \nyour findings. Take the time to learn reportbug. \nYou be surprised in the little contributions that help the greater and I \nthink its a satisfying feeling. \n \n \nDan Pickett also has similar advice on contributing back to Rails 3. He \nmakes a good point that if you are able to demonstrate that you have \ncontributed to Rails that it looks awesome on your CV / Resume. \n \nI could not agree more on this. I know this, because it has worked in my \nfavour. \n \nEveryones mileage may vary, but I believe whole heartily that the really \nwinner is Debian and the community. \n \nKind Regards \nBrent Clark \n \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
