The only thing using Akonadi by default in KDE 4.4 is the new \nKAddressBook. AFAIK. \n \nSo KDE 4.5 might even be more problematic in the beginning. Especially \nwhen I remember the roughnesses of KDE 4.3.0 and KDE 4.4.0 I do not \nsuggest to ship a .0 or even .1 release of KDE. Even KDE 4.4.2 had quite \nsome bugs that KDE 4.4.3 fixed. \n \nSo shipping KDE 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 oder 4.4.5 IMHO could well be a better \noption that to ship KDE 4.5.0 with Debian Squeeze. \n \nSadly I have not seen any KDE 4.x.0 release yet thats really suitable for \nDebian Stable. \n \nCiao, \n-- \nMartin 'Helios' Steigerwald - http://www.Lichtvoll.de \nGPG: 03B0 0D6C 0040 0710 4AFA B82F 991B EAAC A599 84C7",
