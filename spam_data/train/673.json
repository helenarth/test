    "body": "Hi, List! \n \nI have a few simple questions for you: \n \n1 - I there a better place to get help with dash \n2 - Is there way to detect that a script is running as dash, instead of a \nshell like Solaris' /bin/sh \n3 - Corollary to #2, can I expect dash-as-sh to by a hard link or a sym \nlink? (I would think not, but don't know Debian's policy here) \n4 - Reason for #2, is there a way to list all functions declared in a script \nwith dash? Under Solaris' shell, bash, or the korn shell I can use \n\"typeset\" -- I've searched POSIX and don't see a way that doesn't involve \nparsing the script. \n \nThanks, \nWes \n \n-- \nWesley W.
