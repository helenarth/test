I also have an Intel embedded \ncard but IIRC, I disabled it in the BIOS as soon as I plugged the nvidia \ncard (7600 GS). \n \nOTOH, it seems that device ID corresponds to nvida 9400 GT. So I would \ntest with the nvidia Debian drivers. If they do not work, you can always \ncome back and activate the Intel one. \n \n> I'll look into that wiki (again), \n> \n> it can take some time before i answer again: got to take care of my \n> family now, \n \nTake your time.
