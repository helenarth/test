    "body": "Hello List, \n \nI like my audible bell very much. I really really like it – \nunfortunately, Metacity (from current Testing) blocks it in the \nfollowing way: \n \n* \"beep\" works fine \n* \"xkbbell -force\" works, but it doesn't w/o the \"-force\" \n* Gnome-Terminal and all the other applications can only bell \n \"visible\", i. e. I get a flash when enabling the visible bell in \n Metacity's gconf-preferences but no audible bell if I disable it \n (and leave \"audible bell\" enabled). \n* The module pcspkr is compiled into the kernel and works fine, as \n proven above. \n* The volume of the \"Bell\"-output is at 50% in Alsamixer, and as \n proven above, ok this way. \n \nI assume this is the same bug as described in \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/metacity/+bug/486154/ \n \nand comment 50 seems to provide a solution I didn't test yet – my \nquestion is, wether or not there is a Debian-way to enable the bell \nin Metacity or if I have to switch window managers as Piotr Engelking \ndid here: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=551590 \n \nThe hints he gave in this bug report unfortunately don't work for me \n– I enabled the corresponding keys, but still can't hear a bell, \nprobably because I don't use ESD (is there any reason why I should \ninstall this? ALSA works just fine for me…) \n \nBest regards, \n \nClaudius \n \nii metacity 1:2.28.0-3 lightweight GTK+ window manager \nii gnome-core 1:2.28+7 The GNOME Desktop Environment -- ess… \n \n-- \nHome on the Range was originally written in beef-flat. \n \nhttp://chubig.net/ \n \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
