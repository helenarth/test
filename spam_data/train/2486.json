It is a vauluable and reliable service, \n \nValuable yes, since it provides useful video processing apps. I'm using \nit also since recently. It probably is reliable, although for me it did \n break vlc the moment I started using it. \n \n> and is provided by a well-known Debian developer. \n \nGood to know. \n \nHow come there is no link anywhere on debian.org pointing to \ndebian-multimedia.org? Anything to establish a chain of trust. As it is, \nI looked and looked but didn't find. Even when searching for \n\"multimedia\" on debian.org, it does not mention debian-multimedia.org at \nall. Not even when searching for \"debian-multimedia\". Every new debian \nuser trying to verify the credibilitiy of debian-multimedia.org would \nhave given up at this point for sure. \n \nWith the information that Marillat is a Debian developer (and the \nprecise spelling of his name) I was actually able to go to the \ndeveloper's page on debian org, find him, and see a link to d-m. So in a \nvery roundabout way, d-m is actually endorsed by debian.org. But how \nwould anybody find out about this in a reasonable amount of time? \n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- \nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (GNU/Linux) \nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org \n \niEYEARECAAYFAkvMyOsACgkQ+VSRxYk4409xCwCgiXo8AS/wA8db8M2SP4Kv3c2l \nknAAnA2Xq8lPi6RtGd06yiMcbrMe45Ih \n=Kc7/ \n-----END PGP SIGNATURE----- \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
