Ext4 didn't, but it's \npossible that has been / will be put back. XFS uses longer gaps between disk \nsyncs by default, but it is tunable. \n \nYou could always use the \"sync\" file system option to avoid the whole issue. \nIf that's no good enough, a simple shell script (while sleep 5; do sync; done) \nrunning as root (perhaps started from init) will fill basically the same role. \n \nBoth XFS and Ext3/4 recover through journal replay, and it is usually enough. \nRarely, a manual filesystem check will be required, and xfs_check is usually \nmuch faster than fsck.ext3 or even fsck.ext4. \n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr. ,= ,-_-. =. \nbss@iguanasuicide.net ((_/)o o(\\_)) \nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy `-'(. .)`-' \nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/ \\_/",
