Gross profit margin for the three months \nended was \n81%.  Sales increased by \n88% for the three months ended January 31, \n2010 when compared to the same period in the prior year. \n \n   \n \n \n \n EUOK gross profit has grown by 57% for the six months ended \nJanuary 31, 2010 compared to the six months \nended January 31, 2009. Gross profit margin for the six months ended was \n79%.  Sales increased by 49% for the six months ended January 31, 2010 \nwhen compared to the same period in the prior year. \n \n   \n \n \n \n When benchmarked against its \nindustry competitors Revlon (REV:NYSE), Estee \nLauder (EL:NYSE), \nShiseido, and \nLVMH \n(Euronext: MC), EUOK has had significantly more sales growth when \ncompared to the same period in the prior year.  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Company Name \n \n \n \n \n Sales Growth \n \n \n (3 months ended Q1 2010 compared to 3 months ended Q1 \n2009) \n \n \n Increase/(Decrease) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n EUOK \n \n \n \n \n 88% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Estee Lauder Companies \n \n \n \n \n 10% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Revlon \n \n \n \n \n 0.73% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Shiseido \n \n \n \n \n (6.7%) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n LVMH \n \n \n \n \n 11% \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n The growth in sales is primarily due \nto the EUOK brand becoming more established in the \npremium cosmetic channels.  \n \n   \n \n \n \n EUOK current trading price of 0.40 is a steal. \nWe have been following the cosmetics and beauty industry now for quite some \ntime. According to Forbes.com who did an article on the growth of the \ncosmetics industry, beauty products generate nearly 230 billion annually \nin global sales, with a consumer \npreference placed on products that are high tech and natural based (favoring \ncompanies like EUOK). With the current status of the company, \nEUOK is \npoised to grab no less than 1% of global sales, ensuring 230 million in gross sales for \nEUOK. Based off revenue alone that would warrant a $6.57 share \nprice. \n \n   \n \n \n \n The \nfinancials speak for themselves; EUOK is set to make a run and is extremely undervalued. \n \n   \n \n \n \n In \nthe past, large \nmultinational corporations have dominated the market place, but in recent \nyears boutique brands such as EUOK have been at the fore front of consumer \nspending. EUOK is ready to take full advantage of this. \nData released from the NPD Group (a marketing info company based in New \nYork) says luxury cosmetics \nhave grown at an annual rate of 4% - 7% since 2002. Estee \nlauder and \nL���Oreal have realized this and have been \nacquiring companies like \nEUOK in order to meet the demand of \nconsumers. \n \n \n There \nare several reasons behind the growth in high-end cosmetics: the expansion \nof new markets in Russia and Asia; changing social norms that make \nusing cosmetics--not to \nmention undergoing cosmetic surgery--more acceptable; celebrity worship; \npromotion within fashion magazines; improvements in the technology that \ncreates makeup; the influence of mass retailers that can offer lower prices, \nand raising affluence. As cosmetics becomes less expensive, better and more \naccessible, more affluent women--and increasingly men as well--have moved \naway from older brands of makeup and skincare in search of higher-quality \nnew products and more exclusivity. \n \n \n EUOK recognizes this and has gained retail \ndistribution worldwide \nthrough its relationships with department store retail giants such \nas Barneys New York, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, \nBliss, Harrods (London), Printemps (France), La Rinascente (Italy) and Lane \nCrawford (Hong Kong). \n \n \n Upper management of EUOK has a three prong approach to further drive \nglobal brand recognition: \n \n   \n \n \n \n North America  \n EUOK strategy \nin North America is one of strong luxury brand positioning through \npartnerships with premier department stores and flagship locations. \nEUOK \ndepartment store partners include Bergdorf Goodman in New York City, Barneys \nNew York nationwide, Ogilvy, as well as boutique-style department stores \nacross USA and Canada. EUOK also operates brand-owned flagship stores \nin Toronto and Vancouver. EUOK subsidiary, Hewitt-Vevey, is positioned in \nmedical facilities and online, with p \nlans to grow in both directions. Future expansion plans include creating \nnew partnerships with other major department stores, as well as positioning \nwith 5-star hotels in key markets.  \n   \n Europe  \n EUOK \ndistribution in Europe varies by market but is restricted to luxury channels \nthat position the brand amongst the leading luxury skincare brands. Our \nrepresentation includes department stores and perfumeries in major markets. \nThese channels include Printemps in France, Harrods and Liberty in the UK, \nLa Rinascente in Italy, as well as perfumeries in other countries. Expansion \nplans for Europe are focused primarily in the UK and France with \nnegotiations with premier department stores under way.  \n   \n \n \n \n Asia  \n EUOK \ndistribution in Asia varies by country for best positioning amongst the \nleading luxury brands. Our major department store partner in Hong Kong is \nLane Crawford, as well as Joyce. We are also represented through luxury \nperfumeries and spas in Singapore and South Eastern China. Asia represents \nour largest immediate growth potential. We are in communication with major \ndepartment stores and distributors in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other \nmajor markets in China. We expect new accounts for EUOK, as well \nas major interest in WhiteRX, an upcoming product of our subsidiary, \nHewitt-Vevey, to drive significant growth in Asia. We are also in \ncommunication with major retailers in the Middle East and Russia, two \nhigh-potential markets in which we \nare not yet present. \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n Corporate \nSummary \n   \n \n \n \n With confidence, \nwe welcome you to Euoko, an exclusive brand that represents the cornerstone \nof the most innovative, most unique skin treatments. Euoko indeed stands at \nthe intersection of the most noble of commitments to effective active \ntechnology, unsurpassed delivery systems, uncompromised service and a \nmodern, understated image. \n \n   \n \n \n \n Our constantly growing library of active principles currently exhibits \n102 ingredients from Switzerland, Spain, France, Canada, Denmark, the United \nStates, the Amazonian Rainforest, the Kalahari Desert and Denmark. From our \nmost unique hyaluronic acid with no animal origins or strepp bacteria \nderivatives to our recent addition of an extraordinarily effective, \nage-killing peptide that fully mimics Waglerin 1, a peptide that is found in \nthe venom of the Temple Viper, Tropidolaemus wagleri, we stand strongly \nbehind the innovative collection of the noble ingredients found in our \nproducts. Both the safety and effectiveness of our ingredients are important \nto us. We avoid unnecessary preservation or stabilization and respond \nrapidly to emerging innovations in biotechnology, nanotechnology, biology, \npeptides and other active principles. \n \n   \n \n \n \n Further, our proprietary delivery system ensures maximum stability and \nabsorption of our active principles into the skin. This delivery system is \nthe single key catalyst that maximizes the effectiveness of our principles, \nwhile making it possible for high concentrations of our principles to be \nincluded synergistically in our formulations. Highlights of this system \ninclude a strain of red marine algae that maximizes penetration of actives \ninto the skin by causing a controlled immune response when applied \ntopically. This effect is enhanced by the delivery action of our \nmicro-surfactants bound to a pure grade of hyaluronic acid, as well as our \nunique timed-release technology. Every Euoko product embodies Euoko���s \ncommitment to science and quality.
