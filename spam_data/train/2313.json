That's what your employer should be \ntelling you. Microsoft Pocket PC experts will be sharing tips on improving \nworkplace productivity with portable devices. Combined with Proxim's on \nlocation wireless networking solutions, a Pocket PC can keep you and your \nco-workers communicating no matter where you are in the building. Learn \nhow to bring Wi-FI and PDA technologies together for the ultimate in \nportable computing. \nRegister for Gnomedex today! \n\nReader Jack Macdonald has some advice for you would-be bards in the audience: \n\n \"You mention Karaoke being featured at Gnomedex and you \nmight want to point out to other Gnomies that they could \npractice their Karaoke on my Red Hot \nKaraoke Page site. There are the words and music for \nmore than 1100 songs available on the site and by \ndownloading the Yamanha Midiplug (a link is provided) they \ncan even change the key of the song to suit their voice \nrange as well as speed up or slow down the music to their \ntaste. In other words, to have the same experience as they \nwould have with professional Karaoke equipment but at no \nextra cost! At this price (zero) a lot of gnomies going to \nGnomedex could be singing up a storm by being properly \nprepared for your Karaoke.\"\n\n Travel day on Wednesday as I head down to Ankeny, Iowa to \nhelp out a former co-worker and avid Gnomie with some server \nand networking stuff. The tough part is remembering \neverything I'll need. It never fails, though. I always, \nalways, always forget something. I can make lists two weeks \nin advance and I'll end up 30 miles down the road with a \nhandprint on my forehead when I come to the realization that \nI left something important behind. What will it be this \ntime, I wonder? I'll let you know on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n See You in August,               Randy Nieland       \n\n\n\n  GnomeNETWORK \n\nForwarding to Internet Address Fails\n\n http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q181636\n\n Client inquires about the possibility of forwarding all \ninternal and Internet email to his AOL mailbox when he's out \nof the office, and I figure it's going to be a piece of \ncake. He recently acquired a new phone through Verizon along \nwith web access and a tie into his AOL mailbox, which was \nthe driving force behind this request. What I found was that \nInternet email proved to be easy using a simple forwarding \nrule, but none of the internal Exchange email was being sent \nout to the Internet upon receipt, even though it appeared to \nbe included in the rule. As it happens, this is due to a \ndefault configuration option on the Exchange 5.5 server that \nprevents automatic replies/forwards from being sent to the \nInternet using the Exchange Internet Mail Service. A quick \nconfiguration change and restart of IMS will put things \nright.\n\n\n  GnomeSYSTEM \n\nStop the Presses\n\n http://www.wininformant.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=25802\n\n ... The CD presses, that is. Microsoft has given in to \nthe greater good and delayed Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 \nindefinitely. Sure, it's mildly disappointing, but I applaud \nthe move. Instead of trying to downplay the previously \nidentified problems with Microsoft Installer (MSI) 2.0, the \nservice pack will be put on ice until the issues are \nstraightened out. Here's a quote for you... Good job, \nMicrosoft.\n\n\n  GnomeALERTZ \n\nToday's Top 5 kbAlertz\n\n \n\n Q198845 - WD2000: How to Return Only File Names Using FileSearch Property (Q198845)\n\n Q310436 - Cannot Play a DVD in Windows XP (Q310436)\n\n Q321305 - How to Log On to Windows XP If You Forget Your Password or Your Password Expires (Q321305)\n\n Q321146 - Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse Program Causes an Error Message in Windows XP (Q321146)\n\n Q321144 - Visioneer One Touch 8100 Scanner Causes an Error Message in Windows XP (Q321144)\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHRIS TEACHES THE BASICS: If you've got friends or family who want to learn more about their PC, from a guy who makes things nice and easy, check out the VHS release of Computer Basics in the GnomeStore.

It's still worth a mention, however, in case \nyou're not familiar with what it's there for. As you're \nprobably aware, XP contains a file protection scheme that \nwill immediate replace any system files that are deleted or \naltered in any way, ensuring that XP is kept in a stable \nstate. Sometimes this system can get a little out of whack, \nand the SFC is meant to restore order. Note that any \nhotfixes and other Microsoft-provided updates will be left \nin place since they properly update the DLL Cache that is \nused as the sanity check to determine if a system file has \nbeen messed with. To access the SFC, simply launch a command \nprompt and type \"SFC\" to display a list of options.\n\n\n  GnomeSTUFF \n\nConsider This\n Forwarded by JW\n\n http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,72519,00.html\n\n The next time you have a face-to-face with your elected \nrepresentatives, you might want to start asking about their \nopinions on technology laws that are being proposed left and \nright. Holding a public office seems to be introducing brain \ndeath more frequently considering proposals by Senator Fritz \nHollings and now LA congressman Howard Berman. If Mr. Berman \ngets his way, companies may very well be allowed to hack \ninto your systems without proof of provocation in order to \nensure that you are using their software according to the \nstated rules. Mind you, if they cause colateral damage or \nupset other systems, there isn't thing one you can do in \nreturn. Nope, they'll have legal protection. This garbage is \nseriously getting scary. If you think it won't be abused, \nconsider the case of Dimitry Skylarov when he publicly \npointed out eBook security problems with Adobe's software \nand was promptly thrown in jail for his trouble under the \nauthority of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. He was \neventually released, but that doesn't make it any more \nright.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Recommend It!\n \n \n\nhttp://www.lockergnome.com/issues/techspecialist/20020710.html\n Your subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@example.com] - To unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page.
