I \neven set a LID_LIBRARY_PATH variable in case it was not a typo. It \nstill doesn't work. Setting the command line debugging variable, I \nfound that it cannot find the PPD file. Does it only work if the CUPS \nserver is running locally? In our case, we use a central CUPS server \nrunning on a non-standard port. This is reflected \nin /etc/cups/client.conf. How do we tell acroread where the printer \nserver and PPD files are? Thanks - John \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
