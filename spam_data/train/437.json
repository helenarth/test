    "body": "Dear Friend, \n \nAs you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for \nme, because, I believe everyone will die someday. \nMy name is MR Wahid Adada a Crude Oil merchant in IRAN,i \nhave been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer . \nIt has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and \nright now I have only about a few months to live, \naccording to medical experts. \nI have not particularly lived my life so well, as I \nnever really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my \nbusiness. Though I am very rich, I was never \ngenerous, I was always hostile to people and only \nfocused on my business as that was the only thing I \ncared for. But now I regret all this as I now know \nthat there is more to life than just wanting to have \nor make all the money in the world. \nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come \nto this world I would live my life a different way \nfrom how I have lived it. Now that God has called \nme, I have willed and given most of my property \nand assets to my immediate and extended family \nmembers as well as a few close friends. \nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul \nso, I have decided to give alms to charity \norganizations, as I want this to be one of the last \ngood deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed \nmoney to some charity organizations in Austra, cameroun, \nliberia,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has \ndeteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself \nanymore. I once asked members of my family to close \none of my accounts and distribute the money which I have \nthere to charity organization in Bulgaria and \nPakistan, they refused and kept the money to \nthemselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as \nthey seem not to be contended with what I have left \nfor them. \n \nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the \nhuge cash deposit of fifteen million dollars \n$15,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security \nCompany abroad. I will want you to help me collect this \ndeposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. \n \n \nI have set aside 10% for you and for your time. \n \nGod be with you. \n \nMR Wahid Adada",
