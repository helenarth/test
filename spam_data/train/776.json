Somehow \nplasma-desktop was uninstalled during the process :( \n \nI was able to set the TV on the right of my monitor with proper \nresolution. I haven't checked yet if this settings stay after I relogin \nor not (should have been in bed half an hour ago). One thin which still \nhappens is that the KDE panel goes to the TV screen (HDMI signal). How \ncan I set it to stay on the LCD monitor? \n \nOne more quirk: even with the TV screen disabled, the mouse is able to \ntravel beyond the right edge of the LCD monitor display! \n \nThanks, \nKS \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
