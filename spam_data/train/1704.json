This is often because webmasters do not have the\nability or time to design and create unique websites. These\nfive points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design\nfor your website.\n\n1. Navigation System\n\nDeciding on a navigation system should be one of the first\nthings to consider when designing your website. Visitors\nusually look for a way to get to the information they want\nbefore reading anything else. I would suggest putting your\nnavigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase \n(http://www.webmasterbase.com) for example. There is a list \nof categories on the left, and information about the network \non the top bar.\n\nIt is not recommended that you place your navigation at the\nbottom of the page because:\n\n- People see the top of the page first\n- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets\n pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor.\n\n2. Color Scheme\n\nWhen you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For\nexample, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some\ncolors that are often used are white on black or black on\nwhite.\n\nA wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer\n(http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/), created by Aaron\nEpstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in\nchoosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles \n(http://www.freewarefiles.com), Tucows (http://www.tucows.com),\nor Download.com (http://www.download.com) for \"color schemer.\"\n\n3. Content Window\n\nThis is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here\nis easy to read and understand.\n\nAlso, provide your own original content. People do not want to\nhear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what \nyou want to say! While it might be time consuming to write\nyour own content, it sure is worth it.\n\nTo find content for your website, try searching at\nEzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com). Other people may\nhave used the articles, but if you become good friends with the\nauthors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be\ncareful though. Do not use too much content from other \nauthors, as mentioned above.\n\n4. Font(s)\n\nSeveral types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is\nfixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.\nFixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)\n\nAnother type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to\nArial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be \nused for long pieces of text.\n\nThe final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,\nor curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times\n(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,\nis often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because\nits rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it\neasier to read.\n\n5. Advertising\n\nAh, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing \nthat almost every website has. The most common type is what \nis known as \"banner\" advertising. It is called that because it is \nlong and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The \ngeneric kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.\n\nNew sizes however are being used. Take for example the new\nstyle called \"skyscraper\" -- so called for a reason: it looks\nlike a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too\nwide (about 100-125 pixels.)\n\nFinding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners \nused to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.\nNevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle\nof the page, at the bottom, or along the side.\n\n Conclusion\n\nThese are only five things to consider when designing a\nwebsite. There are many others however. Let me know what \nyou find that helps you create a unique website.
