Only Ksensors \nand KPackage require KDE. You say, \"no way to keep all of KDE..\". I \ndon't care about all of KDE. I only want KDM and the utilities I \nlisted above, plus of course the terminal servers. \n \n>> Secondly, KPackage is badly broken.

Without KPackage, there really isn't much \nreason to run KDE. \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
