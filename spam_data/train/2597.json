Some KDE 3.5 installations are \nused by people that probably would have problems getting Debian installed and \nwould think that \"Bugzilla\" was a B movie. \n \nIt would be nice if KDE got input from all it's users. Sometimes it gets 100s \nof users input from a rant from a single email address (their KDE \nadministrator). Luckily, these events can be written off as \n\"just one user's opinion\". :P The rantor is then summarily dismissed because \nthey can't put in another 40 hours a week fixing the issues, since they are \nalready overworked with the job administering a large KDE 3.5 installation. \n:P \n \nI'm convinced real users exist. I just don't use my computer like them. \n \n> developers write what they want \n> to use, no what *you* want to use. \n \nBased on the evidence presented (NB: I have not independently verified it), \nthe developers write what they want and then use something else. You may find \nthat ironic, but that doesn't automatically make it untrue. \n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr. ,= ,-_-. =. \nbss@iguanasuicide.net ((_/)o o(\\_)) \nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy `-'(. .)`-' \nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/ \\_/",
