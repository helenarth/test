But, as you've seen, using the \"raw\" \ndevice name doesn't really help either. Different kernel versions, and even \nkernels compiled with different options, will use different \"raw\" names for \nthe devices. In odd setups, the device name might change from boot to boot as \ndevices are (now) discovered asynchronously so they may be assigned names in a \ndifferent order based how quickly they respond to the kernel. \n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr. ,= ,-_-. =. \nbss@iguanasuicide.net ((_/)o o(\\_)) \nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy `-'(. .)`-' \nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/ \\_/",
