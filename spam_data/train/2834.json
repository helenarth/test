To assist you with marketing \nyour business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable \nmarketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands \nof free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: \nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY \n \n============================================ \nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and \nthose involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive \nonly a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. \nAlso many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). \nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that \nis only 10 orders for report # 1. \n \nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail \neach for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. \nThat's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. \n \nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% \nresponse to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. \n \nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. \nThe 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for report #4. Those 10,000 people send out \n5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that \nis 100,000 orders for Report # 5. \n \nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). \n \n Your total income in this example is: \n \n 1..... $50 + \n 2..... $500 + \n 3..... $5,000 + \n 4..... $50,000 + \n 5..... $500,000 \n Grand Total=$555,550.00 \n \nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE IT OUT! \nTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE \nIT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! \n \n============================================ \nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT \nOF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone \nor half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over \n150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do \njust that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET \n \n============================================ \nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to \nadvertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly \nsuggest you start with Method # 1 and METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, \nall you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service \non all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on \nit, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report. \n \n=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ============ \nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send \n$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is \nconcealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, \nWrite the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS \nand your name and postal address. \n \nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : \n============================================ \nREPORT # 1: \"The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net\" \nOrder Report #1 from: \nB.o.n.e.y Cap \nSuite# 909 -10175-114th Street Edmonton, Alberta,T5k 2L4 Canada \n__________________________________________________ \nREPORT # 2: \"The Insider's Guide to Sending Bulk e-mail on the Net\" \nOrder Report # 2 from: \nVentures 2001 \nBox 445 Station main Edmonton.Alberta,Canada T5J 2k1 \n_________________________________________________ \nREPORT # 3: \"Secret to Multilevel Marketing on the Net\" \nOrder Report # 3 from : \nB.

If you did not, continue advertising or \n sending e-mails until you do. \n \n=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN RELAX, \n because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! \n THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the \n list, you are placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your \n PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you.

One of the \n|people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be \non every one of them. \n \nRemember though, the more you send out the more potential customer you will reach. \nSo my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become \nfinancially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! \n======== MORE TESTIMONIALS ============ \n\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major \nU.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled \nto Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge \nof the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored \nmy supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless \nfun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. \nWell, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the \nnext 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have \njoined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf C.P.A., Chicago, Illinois \n========================================== \n''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate \nin this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that \nthere was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. \n'' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. \nI made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not \nmatter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so \nbig.\" Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada \n=========================================== \n''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given \nit a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was \ne-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did \nnot delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within \n22 weeks.\" Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. \n============================================ \n''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed \nthe simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first \nmonth I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. \nLife is beautiful, Thanks to the internet.\".
