Check the ram dimms are certified for \nyou motherboard and also, look into the BIOS voltages are the correct \nones for you type of ram. \n \n3/ Hard disks health. You can test this with \"smartcl\". \n \nBeing a brand-new computer I would suspect for bad hardware or assembly \nproblems :-/ \n \nGreetings, \n \n-- \nCamale√≥n \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
