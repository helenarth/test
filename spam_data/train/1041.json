Apparently, this is normal. It appears \nthat the userspace battery utilities expect the battery to report mAh, \nbut in fact it reports percentage. This is either a bug in the battery \nfirmware or a bug in the BIOS; it is known to be fixed with newer BIOS \nversions and kernels ≥ 2.6.25. \n*** \n \nTHT. \n \nGreetings, \n \n-- \nCamaleón \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
