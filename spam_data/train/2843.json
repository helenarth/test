What is subjectively unusable for you, is \nperfectly usable for others and the other way round. Debian is not your \npersonal distro, it strives to keep balance. And balance is towards 4.4 side \nyou like it or not due to many factors. When Squeeze is released, KDE 4.5 may \nbe in .3 or later patch release upstream so the point about the latest and \ngreatest here is completely out-of-place. \n \nNow if at particular time upstream software does not meet your personal needs, \nyou go and look for alternatives. You talk like kdepim 4.3 was flawless. But \nit wasn't! There is no place for \"software does not do X, remove it from \nstable\" discussions here. \n \n> > Just find \n> > another software/solution which does, develop it by yourself, pay \n> > somebody to develop it for you or ask kindly and wait till somebody \n> > else is motivated enough to do it. \n> \n> I will, but I see no reason not to air my grievances. \n \nInsisting that others do something (revert to kdepim 4.3) based solely on your \npersonal grievances does not help productive communication. \n \n> > YOU run a dozen of DB servers, \n> \n> I'm not the only person that does.

I find myself in the odd position \nthat I mostly share opinion with you about excessive \"explosion\" of DB server \ninstances on the desktop but I still can't help myself to argue. You started \nthis off on a wrong foot by demanding to accommodate to your needs. \n \n> > YOU say KDE 4.4 is inappropriate for stable. \n> \n> That is my opinion. \n> \n> > Nothing objective and \n> > \n> > YOU assume that your truth is an ultimate one. \n> \n> Not really. I made objective statement about KMail based on observable \n> facts. I also voiced an opinion that I based on that statement. \n \nWhat facts? That kdepim/kmail needs akonadi? That's hardly news. Akonadi \nintegration is not stable enough? There is still time to improve it.

Akonadi by itself is not a bug, it is not going away! \nTake it or switch to something else, simple as that. \n \n-- \nModestas Vainius ",
