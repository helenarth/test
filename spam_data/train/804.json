The memory was installed by the \nshop where I bought the components of my computer. (I was intending to build \nit myself and he didn't trust me with the CPU or memory!!) He told me taht I \nhad dual channel memory installed, and would need to replace both 256 Mb \nsticks if I increased the memory capacity. \n \nI have never seen any sign of dual channel operation. (Tho' I didn't know what \nto look for, which hardly helped!) \n \ndmidecode gives: \n \nMemory Device \n [snip] \n Size: 256 MB \n Form Factor: DIMM \n Set: None \n Locator: A0 \n Bank Locator: Bank0/1 \n [snip] \n \nMemory Device \n [snip] \n Size: No Module Installed \n Form Factor: DIMM \n Set: None \n Locator: A1 \n Bank Locator: Bank2/3 \n [snip] \n \nMemory Device \n [snip] \n Size: 256 MB \n Form Factor: DIMM \n Set: None \n Locator: A2 \n Bank Locator: Bank4/5 \n \nWould I be correct in taking this to mean that the memory modules appear to \nbe incorrectly installed, and that I could improve my memory performance by \nmoving one of the modules that dual channel functions? And also, if that \ndoes not give me enough improvement (which it almost certainly won't), I \ncould add another module in the third channel, which would not necessarily \nneed to be the same size as the other two? \n \nTIA \nLisi \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
