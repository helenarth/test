Their music catalogs were limited, the software was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.coms Rhapsody, a subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure recordings from all five major labels. And now Im rethinking my stance. \n\nRhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download them to a portable player, youll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge, and you cant download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download MP3s?

So it doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?.\" \nAfter Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this response makes the best argument.\n\n \"The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to only one browser.\" \nFew responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall into the Web user category.\n\n \"As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no matter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does.\" \nQuite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while noting the difficulty of testing in every browser.\n\n \"Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the remaining tiny minority has to be justified.\" \nA few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe e-mail address for your subscription is  \n\nUnsubscribe |\n Manage My Subscriptions\n | FAQ |\n Advertise \n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \nPrice comparisons |\nProduct reviews |\nTech news |\nDownloads |\nAll CNET services\n\n \n\n \n \n Copyright 2002 CNET Networks, Inc.
