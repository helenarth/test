Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. \nRegister for Gnomedex today! \n\n\nI've finally done it! Lockrgnome's Top 50 \nMac OS X Tips is in publication \nand available for purchase at GnomeTomes.com. Less than half the tips have \nappeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means \ngetting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've \nwritten that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, \nI'll be ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will \nfind them useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things \non the list has improved my personal OS X experience.\n \nAlthough this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing \nsections of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the \ncontributions of the other two guys. This does not mean either of them is \ntruly less involved, it just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and \nRandy regularly send me links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which \nwill ultimately end up in upcoming issues. Since the writing will be \nprimarily mine, I've opted to eliminate the \"Review by\" links at the bottom \nof each article. Unless otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it. \nIf you need to send me an e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the \nsidebar will reach me, as well as putting your message in front of Chris \nand Randy.\n \nI've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months \nand believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going \nto add a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what \nyour level of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with \nsome really basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting \ntopics. Either way, I'm open to some \nAppleScript suggestions.\n\n\n\n See You in August,               Jake Ludington       \n\n For Mac Outlook users: \nOS X Tips - http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/cat_macintosh.html\n\n\n  GnomeDOWNLOADS \nSherlock Plugins v2.2 [600k] Mac OS 9/OSX FREE \n\nhttp://www.searchstandard.com/ \n\n\nWhile doing some research for my top 50 tips, I discovered that turning \noff some of Sherlock's extras, like multi-language indexing, in the \npreferences will speed things up considerably, particularly for local \nmachine searches. This renewed my interest in finding ways to add-on \nsearch capabilities to the bundled sleuth, resulting in my discovery of \nSearchStandard.com. This bundled collection of search plug-ins makes it \npossible to look for almost anything using Sherlock. Their Web site \nwon't wow you, but SearchStandard's free plugins most certainly make \nfinding things online, including searches on your favorite Mac sites, \nthat much easier.\n\n\n\n\n  GnomeNETWORK \nXnet v1.0.6 [216k] OSX $48 \n\nhttp://bitcom.ch/products-xnet-e.html \n\nDealing with servers that offer mission critical services, like \nintranet access, e-mail, or Web serving, means dealing with those \nservices failing from time to time. Don't be left in the dark \nwhen one of your services go down, let Xnet keep you informed. \nThe unregistered version of the product lets you verify http, \nping, smtp, and ftp service availability, with many more service \nverifications included in the pro version. Xnet runs on your \nlocal machine, verifying remote service availability and sending \nyou a message when those services go down. The interface allows \nfor user-defined services, with alert features for both an e-mail \naccount (mine alerts are going to my cell phone) and locally via \na sound from your machine.\n\n\n\n\n  GnomeTERMINAL \n\nFor OS X installs with multiple users, there may come a time when you \nneed to change ownership of a particular file. This is particularly \nuseful in situations where one user created a file, but an entirely \ndifferent user is the only one who will ever make future decisions \nrelating to that file, like whether to keep it or throw it in the \nTrash. chown is the Terminal command designed to handle this. From \nthe command line type:\n \nsudo chown username filename\n \nYou'll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for \nusername. The name of the file receiving a change of ownership will \nreplace filename.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n50 LINUX TIPS: From the mind behind the Penguin Shell come two \nmore eBooks in the GnomeTome series. Whether you are a Linux newbie \nor command line guru, you'll want these tips as part of your \ninformation arsenal. \nGet your copy \nof Tony's Top 50 PenguinTWEAKS or Top 50 PenguinCORE tips today! \n\n\n\n  GnomeFAVORITE \nSusan Kare \n\nhttp://www.kare.com \n\nAs we move further into the future of Apple's Mac OS evolution, it \nremains important to understand where things evolved from. Susan \nKare designed all the original icons for the Mac OS, way back in \n1983. In fact, that smiling Mac that appears as OS X boots is her \ncreation. Check out her collection of UI artwork, from both Windows \nand Mac operating systems. Also available from Kare.com are Kare \ndesigned icon apparel and collections of fonts as designed by Susan.\n\n\n  GnomeTIP \n\nShow Info gives you access to change the application associated with a \nparticular file type, rename files, and reassign permissions. One of \nthe best features of Show Info is it's ability to store \"comments\" \nrelated to a file or application. This can be a great place to store \ninformation on recently made changes to a file, information from others \nwho've looked at a file, or in the case of applications, serial numbers \nand other pertinent data you may need when dealing with tech support.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\nhttp://www.lockergnome.com/issues/applecore/20020709.html\n Your subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@spamassassin.taint.org] - To unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page.
