Fair enough.\n\n> What I'd recommend in your case [...]\n\nUgh, way too much manual labor. :-)\n\nWhat I've done instead is to create a tiny little \"kernel.spec\" that\ninstalls no files but claims to produce a kernel package having version\nnumber `uname -r` for architecture `uname -p`. It also claims to\nprovide kernel-sources at the same version. That is enough to make\nalsa-driver.spec happy, and at least forms a reasonable representation\nof what my homemade kernel provides to the system. I should have\nthought of this approach sooner.\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list \nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list",
