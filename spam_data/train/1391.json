That sentiment has been echoed in this thread, by \nStan I think, with statements like (paraphrasing): XFS is good for \nproduction servers which have uninterruptible power supplies. \n \nThe resilience is due to the way the journal is written, if I \nunderstand correctly. Maybe somebody on this list who understands it \nbetter can confirm or deny. There is a journal_data_writeback option \nfor ext3 which will speed up writes to the filesystem, but reduce its \nresilience to power loss. With this option enabled, I recall reading \nthat the ext3 benchmarks are pretty similar to XFS. \n \nI'm not an expert, so don't take my word for it. Do some research on it \nyourself, or wait for the real experts to chime in and correct me :) \n \n-Rob \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
