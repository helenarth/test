The flaws let attackers take control of the device's file system, giving them the power to overwrite files or lock the device so no data can be input through the keypad or touch screen.\n \n\nJuly 11, 2002, 12:50 PM PT\n | \n\nRead Full Story \n \nOutlook plug-in could let the hackers in \n\nA widely used plug-in for Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client that lets users encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack.\nSecurity company eEye Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. Network Associates released a patch for the problem Wednesday as well.\n \n\nJuly 11, 2002, 11:05 AM PT | \n\nRead Full Story \n \n\n \nACLU: Don't rat out your customers \n\nA clutch of civil liberties groups is asking small Internet service providers to get a backbone and stand up to companies seeking to unveil anonymous critics.\nA group including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the Center for Democracy and Technology is urging ISPs to alert customers when they are the targets of so-called John Doe legal actions, which try to unmask the identities of people who anonymously air their companies' dirty laundry. The group has sent letters to more than 100 ISPs, asking them to adopt a written policy promising to let customers know if they're targets.\n \n\nJuly 11, 2002, 12:35 PM PT\n | \n\nRead Full Story \n \nShareholders sue PayPal, eBay \n\nThe PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.\nThe lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.\n \n\nJuly 11, 2002, 11:50 AM PT\n | \n\nRead Full Story \n \nEllison: I don't need an understudy \n\nDeflecting continuing calls for a No. 2 executive, Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison said again Wednesday that the company does not need anyone to back him up.\nEllison, responding primarily to recent news stories that the company might need a second in command, said the current team is enough to guide Oracle.\n \n\nJuly 10, 2002, 6:05 PM PT\n | \n\nRead Full Story \n \n \nFrom our partners: \n \nMeet Microsoft, home networker \n\nBusiness Week\n \n\nThe Colossus of Redmond's next bold move is into routers that'll let consumers connect their digital devices together and to the Net.\n \n\nJuly 11, 2002\n | \n\nRead Full Story \n \nSprint: Not out, but winded \n\nBusiness Week\n \n\nWhile it's hardly the next WorldCom, slowing wireless growth and red ink in long-distance are hardly fuel for its stock. \n\nJuly 11, 2002\n | \n\nRead Full Story \n \n \nAlso from CNET: \n \nReal-time stock quotes from CNET News.com Investor. 30-day free trial!\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDigicams for summer shutterbugs Going on vacation, or just headed to the beach?
