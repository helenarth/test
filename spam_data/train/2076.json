    "body": "Hi all, \n \nwith respect to my problem that the video callback is triggered more often than I want to (see below) I had a guess that it is related to the device frame rate. In that context I tried to set the frame rate of my inbuilt iSight to 1 and SGGetFrameRate did confirm this: \n \n err = SGSetFrameRate(videoData->sgchanVideo,IntToFixed(1)); \n Fixed *frameRate; \n SGGetFrameRate(videoData->sgchanVideo,frameRate); \n int rate = FixedToInt(*frameRate); \n cout dFC->videoBlocker->lock(); \n sj->dFC->videoWaiter->wait(sj->dFC->videoBlocker); \n \n err = SGIdle(videoData->seqGrab); \n usleep(1000000/1); //// FRAMERATE \n \n sj->dFC->videoBlocker->unlock(); \n } \n} \n \nIn this example the thread waits for 1 second before executing the next time, which results in a frame rate of 1 fps. However, I discovered some strange system behavior, which forced me to verify if this is really the case: I applied a time measurement between each data proc function call and in fact it is executed 4 more times ins between in approx. 250 microsecond intervals. In the following I have plotted the measured interval times in ms: \n \n1000.38 \n0.026 \n0.023 \n0.024 \n0.027 \n1002.55 \n0.025 \n0.026 \n0.022 \n0.021 \n1002.61 \n0.026 \n0.021 \n0.02 \n0.024 \n1002.54 \n0.026 \n0.023 \n0.024 \n0.02 \n1000.18 \n0.026 \n0.137 \n0.025 \n0.024 \n \netc .... and so forth. This is actually not happening when I reside above a framerate of 25 fps. Can anyone tell me why this is happening and how I can prevent this to happen ? \n \nThanks a lot in advance, best \n \n-- A l e x \n _______________________________________________ \nDo not post admin requests to the list.
