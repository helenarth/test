    "body": "Hello all, \n \nI just received a notification that meta-kde 5:59 has entered unstable/sid. \nWith that, the meta package kde-minimal does no longer exist, so /usr/share/live-helper/lists/kde- \ncore should be updated and possibly again when 5:59 gets into testing/squeeze. \n \nThis is the contents of that file now (primairily for debian-kde list): \n#if DISTRIBUTION lenny \nkde-core \n#endif \n#if DISTRIBUTION squeeze sid \nkde-minimal \n#endif \n \nkdm \ndesktop-base \n \n \nI think the following change should correct the change in the meta-package: \n#if DISTRIBUTION squeeze sid \nkde-minimal \n#endif \n \nbecomes: \n \n#if DISTRIBUTION squeeze \nkde-minimal \n#endif \n#if DISTRIBUTION sid \nkde-plasma-desktop \n#endif \n \nand when 5:59 gets into testing it should become: \n#if DISTRIBUTION squeeze sid \nkde-plasma-desktop \n#endif \n \nI'm CC-ing debian-kde list, since they probably can add sth useful to this. \n \nRegards, \n Diederik \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
