Even if you had retained your 2002-era BNR \nknowledge, the prevailing use of framework-provided view controllers \nin UIKit is a pretty significant change with lots of interesting (and \nmostly very positive) consequences. Even some Cocoa old-timers had a \nhard time grasping it at first--I'm living proof! That being said, I \ndon't know if BNR is covering a lot of iPhone material now (though I \nassume that's the case) or if they're still more Mac-focused, so check \nfirst. \n \n-- \n// jack \n// http://nuthole.com \n// http://learncocoa.org \n _______________________________________________ \nDo not post admin requests to the list.
