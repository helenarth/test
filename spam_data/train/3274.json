Apt depends on the dependency graph being consistent, other \nthan perhaps containing a cycle or two. If the Debian maintainers slip \nup and screw up the dependencies (or the user is switching back and \nforth between distributions, say among stable, testing, and unstable), \napt can get confused. It has happened to me several times. In such \ncases, using aptitude sometimes helps. I have also resorted to \ninstalling by hand, though this may not have been strictly necessary. \n \nMAA \n \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
