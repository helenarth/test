I \nmade the same argument as you quite some time ago in favor of 32bit Linux \nfor small systems such as netbooks. I was shot down and educated on the \nactual memory footprint of the x86-64 binaries, and it turns out they're not \nthat much larger overall, and not nearly to the size that one should need \n4GB RAM on a netbook. Most of them come with 2GB anyway, which should be \nmore than enough for just about all application mixes, whether one chooses a \n64bit OS+apps or 32bit. \n \n> I admit I am just knowledgeable enough to be dangerous, rather than an \n> expert, but on this subject I am confident I am correct. \n \nCorrect in that one should get 4GB on a netbook due to 64bit binary size? \nOr correct that 64bit binaries are (slightly) larger than 32bit binaries? \nI'd agree with you on the latter but not on the former. Stating the case of \nthe former is spreading misinformation. I attempted to shoot it down. It \nis simply not correct to recommend 4GB for the reason you stated. \n \n> Please do not try to insult. It is not really useful, and wastes time. \n \nApologies. It wasn't meant as an insult but as an exclamation point backing \nincredulity. \n \n-- \nStan \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
