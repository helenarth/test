The IW add-on \"tor button\" configuration \nlocated at \n \n Preferences/ Proxy Settings \n \nlists 2 options: \n \n(a) Use the recommended proxy settings for my version of Firefox (and a \ncheckbox is marked next to the only sub-option \"Use Polipo\" by default) or \n(b) Use custom proxy settings \n \nHand on heart I could not say when this change took place as I haven't \nbeen using IW + tor + privoxy for a while, so this came as quite a \nsurprise. There was a recent update to tor though, IIRC, so it may well \nhave been during that. \n \nAG \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
