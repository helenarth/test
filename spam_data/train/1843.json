What kind of port nomenclature is that? :-? \n \nI would expect \"/dev/ttyUSB0\" for an USB device or \"/dev/ttyS0\" for the \nfirst rs-232 port... \n \nI think the application is crashing because cannot establish a connection \nwith the device. \n \nGreetings, \n \n-- \nCamaleón \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
