Does that happen often, or only that once? \n \nFor now it has happened twice ... it could be that I have \ninstalled/configured something after logging in the first time. \n \nWhat is happening permanently is that if I click the logout button the whole \ndesktop freezes. I have to press CTRL+ALT+F[1-6] to restart kdm \n \nWhat I am missing now is also the old behavior from CTRL+ALT+DEL to get \nprompt for reboot or shutdown - or whatever. Now this combination is \nlocking the screen. Was it adopted from newer windows? \n \n>> \n> \n> Thanks. It will stay unusable for you until you tell us what you need \n> to use it! That's what I'm here for. \n> \n \nWell, \n- kplayer was not working for DVB input. \n- korganizer does not start \n- kweather and kmoon are not visible (can not choose to activate), though it \nstates it's installed. \n \n- ALL kde apps like kplayer/organizer and probably others start very slowly \nabout 20-30secs to pop up \n \n \nI'm sorry but I can not test anything that fast. it will take few weeks. \n \nI will probably test upgrading (As I said) from lenny to squeeze to sid. To \nsimulate an upgrade of my current system. I think this is more important. \nThis will take a while, so my plan for now is to see what basically works \nand what not. \n \nregards \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
