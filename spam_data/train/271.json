For this reason, NVIDIA is dropping support, on new GPUs, for the \nxf86-video-nv driver. \n \nDetails: \n \n- NVIDIA will continue to support the existing functionality and \nexisting level of acceleration in the nv driver for existing GPUs, \non existing, and (within reason) future, X server versions. \n \n- NVIDIA will not support the xf86-video-nv driver on Fermi or \nlater GPUs. \n \n- NVIDIA will not support DisplayPort, on any GPU, in the \n xf86-video-nv driver.\" \n*** \n \nSo I think the \"nv\" driver will keep the same \"bugs|features\" that has \nright now and will still get some security patches, but I'm afraid that's \nall we (linux users) can expect. \n \n¹ http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2010-March/049749.html \n \nGreetings, \n \n-- \nCamaleón \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
