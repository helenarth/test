There were two ways \nyou could get broken holds, and I fixed one in version 0.4.11: \n \n * The aptitude dependency resolver will now refuse to adjust held \n packages or install forbidden versions unless you manually allow \n it to. This behavior can be disabled by setting \n Aptitude::ProblemResolver::Allow-Break-Holds to \"false\". \n \n aptitude will still break holds when packages are being \n automatically installed; there is a pending patch against apt that \n eliminates this behavior. \n \n and the other in 0.5.9rc1: \n \n + [all] aptitude now uses the new hooks in apt to prevent the greedy \n resolver from removing packages or breaking holds. \n \n (Closes: #177374, #205049, #374353, #376802, #406506, \n #430816, #434731, #442420, #452589) \n \n I am not, at present, aware of any other circumstances where aptitude \nwrongly breaks holds. That said, I don't put packages on hold very \noften, so I depend on users to send bug reports if they're seeing that \nbehavior. \n \n Daniel \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
