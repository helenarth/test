Thanks - John \n \nMmmm, that should not affect. If you can print from other programs, \nAcroread should do the same. If it fails, it sounds to me like a bug on \ntheir side. \n \nGreetings, \n \n-- \nCamaleón \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
