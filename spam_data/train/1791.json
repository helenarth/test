I can't really tell if it was my \nhacking that removed it, or if it was some transitional magic \nhappening since this was the first invocation of that version of \nexmh. I've backed out my stuff now, and'll let you know if it happens \nagain.\n\n\nOn another thing with the Ftoc_RescanLine stuff. This routine is \ncalled at times still unclar to me. An inspection of the routine \nsuggests that it is used in the transition of a message to/form \n\"current\" state to re-paint the ftoc line. However, checking the \nmsg.tcl code (MSgChange) we find:\n\n if {$msgid != {}} {\n # Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line \ninstead\n if {$msgid ",
