Please \ncheck my facts, I'd love to know if I'm wrong. \n \nSome of that reiserfs performance came from directories-as-hash-tables, which \nI believe ext3/4 supports and is native for btrfs. Some of that also came \nfrom tail-packing, which could come from the extents feature of ext4 and \nshould be in btrfs. The final edge reiserfs had was above-average \nflushing/caching algorithms, and the development pushes in ext4 and btrfs have \nlikely reduced or eliminated that; I think the unified block-device caching \nsystem in the kernel able helped make that not such a big deal. \n \n> I'm a Reiser3 user myself, and I've never had any problems with it. \n> \n> (The trouble with it being \"long in the tooth\" is mostly hypothetical, \n> isn't it?) \n \nNot really. Reiserfs will probably be maintained in the kernel for a very \nlong time, in that as any interfaces it uses are updated it will be updated to \nuse the new interface. However, ISTR there are open bugs on reiserfs that \nwill not be fixed. Similarly, I expect new bugs that can be blamed on the \nreiserfs code are less likely to be fixed than bugs than can be blamed on the \next2/3/4 or xfs code. \n \nIn addition, as file system technology advances, reiserfs will become less \nattractive for new installs and it will become more attractive to migrate away \nfrom it. Unfortunately, migration tools are unlikely to be developed, outside \nof generic file system migration tools. Compare with btrfs_convert which \nallows an ext2/3 file system to be converted to btrfs with no data copying; \nsuch tools have to be aware of the internal structure of the file system and \nfewer and fewer developers will even HAVE that knowledge of reiserfs. The \nsource will be available, sure, but even kernel maintainers interested in file \nsystems are not interested in reiserfs. \n \nThere's no drop-dead date for reiserfs in the kernel (AFAIK), so there's no \npressing need to migrate away from it, but there is a lot of work on file \nsystems that should both perform better and be supported better than reiserfs. \n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr. ,= ,-_-. =. \nbss@iguanasuicide.net ((_/)o o(\\_)) \nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy `-'(. .)`-' \nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/ \\_/",
