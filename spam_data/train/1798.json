This time... \n> \n \nI've used dd to push a copy of a working system onto larger drives in the \npast. So my misuse of the term \"migrate\" is me actually doing a copy of the \nworking system to a new, larger device and then zap the original. \n \nI'd hoped there was a block by block way to do it so I didn't have to set \nup the partitions & filesystems ahead of time but I suppose that part won't \nbe too painful. \n \nThe system is relatively idle during these types of surgeries because I \nboot from a live CD so the data on disk isn't churning. \n \nThanks to all who responded, it gave me a lot to consider for this type of \nproject. Like doing proper diffs afterwards to make sure everything landed \non the new device properly! \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
