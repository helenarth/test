If you update your antivirus software on a regular basis,\nthese new versions of Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance.\nBut if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the\ncontinuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate you. In security\nnews, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could affect\nOutlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFrethem.k worm wants to give you a password \n An e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with\na password is yet another variant from the pesky Frethem worm\nfamily. Frethem.k, technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also\ncalled Frethem.l by some vendors, uses its own SMTP engine to\nsend e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. This\nworm does not carry a destructive payload. Mac and Linux users\nare not affected.\n \n\n \nYaha.e screensaver worm spreading \n The Yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly\nscreensaver, proving that users worldwide are still opening\nattached files from total strangers. Yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also\nknown as Lentin.e, Yaha.f, and Yaha.g) is a successful variant of\na worm first seen around Valentine's Day this year. Thankfully,\nthis worm does not affect Mac, Linux, or Unix users.\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \nLeaky PGP Outlook plug-in \nPGP 7.03 and 7.04, widely used plug-ins for Microsoft's Outlook\ne-mail client, inadvertently weakens security and leaves the mail\nprogram open to attack. Fortunately, there is a patch available.\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Digital photography starter kit This guide to digital photos will show you the best products to take your images from snap to finish.\n \n \n  Panasonic's littlest Lumix \n  Minolta\"s 4-megapixel Dimage F100 \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Most popular products \n Digital cameras \n 1.
