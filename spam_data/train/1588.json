    "body": "Hello everyone! \n \nAccording to this tutorial (http://d-i.pascal.at/) I was able to start \nthe installation process from USB stick on my: \n \nHP 5700 Thin Client Terminal \n1 GHz Processor \n512 RAM \n256 internal flash drive \n \nBut I get stuck because there is not enough space even for minimal \ninstallation (netinstall.iso). \nNow the question: \n \nI have also another 4GB USB stick. Can I Install the biggest parts of \nthe system on it? \nIf yes, which parts of the filesystem do I need place on internal flash \nmemory (IDE ATA, faster), and \nwhich on the USB stick? \n \nThe device will be used as a FTP, NAS etc. \n \nThanks on advance \nKrzysztof \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
