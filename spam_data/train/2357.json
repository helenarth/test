What is the brand of \nyour enclosure. I want to look for it, in particular, and see if it claims \nthe feature that you have discovered. Actually, on looking a little more \nclosely, I'm not seeing any case of a single enclosure that can be used \nwith both ATA and SATA. Do I read your post correctly - your enclosure can \ncontain either a SATA or an ATA, and work over USB? But SMART only works \nwhen it is enclosing an ATA? \n \n-- \nPaul E Condon \npecondon@mesanetworks.net \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
