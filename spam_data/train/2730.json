I wonder which package to file a \nbug report against? The k3b package may in fact be easiest to request \nthat the sound files be packaged in .ogg format, but that only masks \nthat fact that something in the KDE sound stack is having an issue with \n.wav files. \n \nMy system is configured to use the Phonon Xine Backend in Sound and Video \nConfiguration. Could that be the culprit and how can we test? \n \n- Nate >> \n \n-- \n \n\"The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all \npossible worlds.
