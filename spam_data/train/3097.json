You then consider it a shell \ncommand and try to excute it. Why would you want to do that? What do you \nwant to do with that output? \n \nBTW: I would suggest that you actually use a .my.cnf to hold the \npassword, otherwise the password is available in e.g. the output of 'ps \nauxww' \n \n-- \nTzafrir Cohen | tzafrir@jabber.org | VIM is \nhttp://tzafrir.org.il | | a Mutt's \ntzafrir@cohens.org.il | | best \ntzafrir@debian.org | | friend \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
