    "body": "I'm running QuickTime on Windows (XP SP3) and have a reproducible way to \nmake MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer in a C++ program do something strange. \nIt looks like it's calling exit() or doing something equivalent, but I can't \nsay for sure. What I do see is that immediately after calling \nMovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer, execution continues in the destructors of my \nstatically allocated objects. If I replace the call to \nMovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer with a call to exit(), I see the same thing. \n \nI'm using version 7.3 of the QuickTime SDK, but \n \nlong version; \nGestalt(gestaltQuickTimeVersion,&version); \n \npopulates version with 0x07668000. I can reproduce the same behavior with \nversion 7.1 of the QuickTime SDK, but Gestalt still returns the same thing \nin this case. \n \nThe QuickTime-related things that happen before this are: \n \n- QuickTime initializes normally \n- QuickTime reads metadata from one aac file \n- QuickTime reads metadata from a second aac file \n- Quicktime reads the audio properties of an mp3 file \n- and then I call MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer \n \nThe audio-related function calls are: \n \nMovieAudioExtractionBegin \nMovieAudioExtractionGetProperty(kQTPropertyClass_MovieAudioExtraction_Audio, \n \nkQTMovieAudioExtractionAudioPropertyID_AudioStreamBasicDescription); \nMovieAudioExtractionSetProperty(kQTPropertyClass_MovieAudioExtraction_Audio, \n \nkQTMovieAudioExtractionAudioPropertyID_AudioStreamBasicDescription); \n \nall of which work as expected (or at least I think they do). \n \nAnd then \n \nMovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer \n \nI can give more details about the API calls if necessary. I think I'm \ncalling QuickTime correctly since it decodes audio successfully almost all \nthe time -- with this file and many others (i.e. \nMovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer returns normally). I've had customers report \nsimilar problems, but this is the first time I've been able to reproduce it \nreliably myself. Unfortunately it's with a complex program. My attempts to \nreproduce this with a simpler program have failed. It seems to be \ntiming-related but I can't do better than that at the moment. \n \nI'd love some help figuring out what's happening in \nMovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer, and even better some help making it go away. \nIf I need to report this in some more official way to Apple to make that \nhappen, please let me know. \n \nThanks much. \n \n-DB \n \n _______________________________________________ \nDo not post admin requests to the list.
