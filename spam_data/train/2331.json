    "body": "Hi, \n \nWhen running pascal programs based on fpGUI, an X11 based interface package, I get an error if the application needs to create the top level (root?) X11 window. but only then. If there is already a toplevel window, for example because xterm runs, then the application open its window and everything behaves as expected. \n \nthe problematic call is this: \n \nXGetWMProtocols(FDisplay, AWindow, @Protocols, @Count); \n \ngdb shows these values (if there is an X11 window, the values are exactly the same): \n \n4: COUNT = 0 \n3: PROTOCOLS = 0x0 \n2: AWINDOW = 6291457 \n1: this->FDISPLAY = 0x803a00 \n \nThis call produces this X11 error: \n \nX Error of failed request: BadAtom (invalid Atom parameter) \n Major opcode of failed request: 18 (X_ChangeProperty) \n Atom id in failed request: 0x0 \n Serial number of failed request: 103 \n Current serial number in output stream: 104 \n \nSystem: Mac OS X 10.6.3 \n \nX11 version: \nmichael% X -version \nX.org Release 7.3 \nX.Org X Server 1.4.2-apple53 \nBuild Date: 20100211 \n \nSomeone suggested XSync and XInterAtom , but I am fairly clueless, when it comes to X11. So could you give me directions how to resolve this? \n \nMichael _______________________________________________ \nDo not post admin requests to the list.
