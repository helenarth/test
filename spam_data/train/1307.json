Activity \nselection is slow, it forgets which activity is mapped to which desktop \nfrom time to time and and and... I reported about 10 bugs just regarding \nthat activity system in KDE's bugtracker, of which a user named Beat Wolf \nmarked most invalid in the last days cause this stuff gets completely \nrewritten in KDE 4.5. In KDE 4.5 there will be a new activity system \nsporting Nepomuk and whatnot, I think there has been a blog post, maybe by \nAaron Seigo on Planet KDE.I agree rewriting the stuff is one of the better \nthings you can do with it ;-). Let's see what comes out of it. \n \n-- \nMartin 'Helios' Steigerwald - http://www.Lichtvoll.de \nGPG: 03B0 0D6C 0040 0710 4AFA B82F 991B EAAC A599 84C7",
