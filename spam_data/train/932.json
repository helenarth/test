Or at least you must be unaware about the existence \nof pdftk toolkit, iTex and gnupdf library, xournal or pdfedit, a set of \napplications and frameworks available in this \"GNU/Linux world\", intended \nfor PDF editing and manipulation. \n \nThere is more than PDF/A (a PDF spec for archiving purposes) out there. \n \nHave you ever heard about PDF forms (editing required), about adding \nbookmarks inside a PDF file structure, about making annotations or \nmarkups or just creating a link? \n \nThere are many situations where the user has the PDF file but lacks the \noriginal document, and if you want to perform any modification in that \nfile, we (linux users) are stuck :-/ \n \nGreetings, \n \n-- \nCamale√≥n \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
