Now, if you had a board with completely closed HW, but that \npresented an open, well documented interface for the driver, most \npeople would be very happy (although there are, of course, the open \nhardware crusaders - more power to them!). So, now that they've simply \nimplemented some of that functionality in SW, in the form of firmware \nwhich the driver installs on the card, but which has nothing to do with \nyour host machine, are you really any worse off? \n \nCelejar \n-- \nfoffl.sourceforge.net - Feeds OFFLine, an offline RSS/Atom aggregator \nmailmin.sourceforge.net - remote access via secure (OpenPGP) email \nssuds.sourceforge.net - A Simple Sudoku Solver and Generator \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
