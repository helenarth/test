At least the \nthe Debian patch tracking system shows the bristuff-patches: \n \n[1] http://bit.ly/bRRHe7 \n \nWe have a QuadBRI-Card and recently needed support from Junghanns.net \nbut they refused telling us there is no bristuff installed because of \nthe show version output: \n \n*CLI> show version \nAsterisk 1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny1 built by pbuilder @ grnetbox on a \nx86_64 running Linux on 2009-12-14 19:04:56 UTC \n \nWhy was the \"bristuffed\" line removed? Debian/Etch did have that \npostfix. \n \nAfter telling them Debian/Lenny IS bristuffed they said this \n\"installation method\" is not supported.
