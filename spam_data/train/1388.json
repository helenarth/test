Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. \nRegister for Gnomedex today! \n\n\nTo all you Dream Theater fans out there, please accept my humblest of apologies. \nI mistakenly announced their break up in the last GnomeAudio section, causing \nquite a stir among a number of subscribers. In fact, they just released a double \nalbum this year and have been touring in support of that release. \nFor today's false alarm, please make note of the tragedy that is the N'SYNC \nbreakup (oh wait, that's just wishful thinking).\n \nI know I've already carried on about my Kyocera 6035 phone, but this thing is \nawesome. I've got all my contacts in one device. Web browsing is good - I'm \nsure it would be better on a color screen, like the \nTreo 270, but for what I'll need, \nthis works well. I'm currently looking for an ssh client I can install, so that \nremote server logins will be possible. My one complaint is the base station's \nuse of a serial connector instead of USB, but I suppose they were cutting costs. \n \nI'm also scoping out the \nPalm Markup Language \n(PML) standard for marking up Palm Docs, \nin an effort to make the GnomeTomes a little flashier. I've installed several of \nthe files on my phone and while they are easy to read, have all the content \norganized, and function as useful tips for the various subjects, I'd like to add \nsome minor tweaks to future tomes, so that they look even better for me and \nanyone else who reads them on their Palm. \n\n\n\n\n Jake Ludington        \n\n\n\n  GnomePRODUCER \nTomeRaider v2.0 [1673k] W98/W2K/Pocket PC/Palm $25 \n\nhttp://www.tomeraider.com/ \n\n\nOf the formats Lockergnome uses for our GnomeTomes, TomeRaider is by far my \nfavorite. Designed with a feel similar to CHM, the TR format is quite easy \nto read, as it places section titles in a pane separate from content, \nallowing you, the reader, to navigate through our tips (or anything else) \nwith much greater ease than the linear format the other versions present. \nThe Windows version of the software is truly designed with ease of use in \nmind. Creating ebooks for TomeRaider is a simple matter of combining a \nmodified set of HTML tags with the designation for page breaks. The \nonly trick for Yankees like me is remembering that center is tagged centre \nin the software.\n\n\n\n\n\n  GnomeFEATURE \nThe Herd of Star Wars Nerds \n\nhttp://www.ifilm.com/ifilm/product/film_info/0,3699,2439321,00.html?cch=11 \n \nTriumph the dog is low-tech, he's not cute like the pets.com sock puppet, \nbut he manages to maintain a twisted appeal to fans of lowbrow comedy. In \nthis segment, Triumph makes a mockery of geeks standing in line for \nEpisode II. Whether you've been one of those geeks yourself, or you've \nnever understood why anyone would dress up and wait in line for a movie, \nyou'll still find this film amusing. 10 minutes was more than necessary \nto get the point across, yet Triumph delivers enough one-liners \nthroughout to keep you watching all the way to the end.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  GnomeSKIN \n\n\n\n\nKids World for DesktopX by Frogboy \n\nPosted on 7/14/2002 12:35:00 AM --    \n \n\n \n\n\n[Download]\n -- [Zoom]\n -- [Visit WinCustomize]\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  GnomeAUDIO \nHeleen van den Hombergh \n\nhttp://www.heleenvandenhombergh.com/ \nhttp://artists.mp3s.com/artists/378/heleen_van_den_hombergh.html \n \n \nClassic jazz vocal styling, juxtaposing arrangements of contemporary \npieces with arrangements of jazz standards. Combined with some \nbeautiful piano arrangements, Heleen's voice is a thing of beauty. A \nNetherlands native, who originally dreamed of saving the rainforests \n(at least according to her biography), her interpretation of American \njazz standards and show tunes is more remarkable than most native \nEnglish speaking vocalists. No world tour is currently scheduled, so \nyou'll probably have to journey to Europe to see her in person, but \nfor those of you living elsewhere in the world, the Internet makes a \nfabulous venue for experiencing Heleen van den Hombergh's talent. \n\n\n\n \n\nA BOOK FOR EVERY GEEK: Want to know more about \nnetworking? \nHave you ever wanted to \nwrite an e-book?

List song names, time of day, \nplaylist information, filenames, and a variety of other more obscure \ninformation. Changing caption colors is also doable within this \nplug-in. A set of hot keys makes controlling Winamp from your keyboard \nmore functional, although you can't remap any of the keys.\n\n\n\n\n  GnomeDVD \n\n \n \nClick for Details\n\nThe Man Who Wasn't There (R) 2001 \nDrama - 116min \nReviewer's Tilt (9) \n\n\n\n\n Special DVD Features worth a look-Thornton and Coen Brothers Commentary\n\nMuch more film noir, than a movie trying to imitate film noir, The Man\nWho Wasn't There captures the inevitable hopelessness of the genre. Ed\nCrane (Billy Bob Thornton) is the archetype everyman. A barber by trade,\nCrane represents the individual in society. He hears everything, but\ntruly knows nothing. Everything he hears is modified ever so slightly by\nthe retelling. He gets neither the whole story nor the true motivations.\nLeft to guess at the motivations and desires of those around him, Crane\ndevelops an indifference to it all. When a snake oil sales man slithers\ninto town, Crane takes this opportunity to cheat the cheaters and punish\nthe punishers. As indifferent as Crane appears, he is no match for the\namorality of fate. As much as fate is indifferent in its wrath, however,\nso is it artistic in its execution. That is what makes our lives so\nentertaining. Fate doles ultimate justice, but never as expected. The\nMan Who Wasn't There is truly a Kafkaesque tale of an individual's year\nto turn against the tide of inevitability. Atypical of cuter, more\nrecent Coen brothers fare, this film is reminiscent of their earlier\nnoir works like Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. Frances McDormand\ndoes an outstanding job making as Crane's selfish wife and James\nGandolfini exudes boorishness as Doris' boss. The real outstanding\nperformances, however, rest with the supporting cast. Tony Shalhoub, as\npompus attorney Freddy Riedenschneider and Jon Polito as the snake oil\nsalesman impress and entertain as cruel, but offbeat parodies of their\ncharacters. The black and white cinematography by Roger Deakins also\nimpresses and precisely underscores the bleakness of Crane's life and\nthe monochromatic nature of fate.\n\n \n\n \n Region 1 Encoding (US and Canada only)\n Format: B&W, Widescreen Anamorphic, Closed Captioned\n Sound: Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround Spanish, Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround French\n Billy Bob Thornton, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen Commentary\n Deleted Scenes\n Making-of Featurette\n Interview with Director of Photography Roger Deakins\n Photo Gallery\n Trailers\n\n\n\n Review by Brett Trout\n\n\n\n\n\n  GnomeWALLPAPER \n\n\n\n\nIsolation for Photo Manipulation by fake[x] \n\nPosted on 7/14/02 11:08PM --    \n \n \n \n\n[Download]\n\n -- [Zoom]\n -- [Visit DeskMod]\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n\nhttp://www.lockergnome.com/issues/digitalmedia/20020715.html \n Your subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@spamassassin.taint.org] - To unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page.
