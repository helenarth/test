I'll agree, its funny, his voice is squeaky and\n I'm jealous that he got on radio and I didn't...\n\n But really, WTF is the big deal about warchalking? I have yet to\n see any of it, anywhere.\n\n LInk will probably pop up on www.npr.org later today.\n\n \n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net",
