The make-kpkg \noutput contained 8839 lines of output just to describe unlinking things \nin the debian/... directory. That 8839 lines is about 980kB. There was \nlater objcopy output from the make-kpkg process amounting to 180kB. The \nrest of the output is 73kB. It's a significant difference. \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
