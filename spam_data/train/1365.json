But the problems I had with Gnome and Xfce on this system \noccurred not only in Squeeze, but also when running an Ubuntu LTS \nversion and Debian Stable. I only saw those problems when using the \nrestricted / glx drivers. Never with nv or vesa. I think this is, \nperhaps, more a measure of the card itself than the drivers. But I know \na number of people with \"high end\" graphics cards from nvidia who have \nreported the same sorts of issues that I saw. It doesn't really matter \nmuch as these particular systems are no longer used as graphics \nworkstations. As they've aged we stuck Linux on them and use them as \nadmin workhorses, a job for which they are admirably suited because of \nall of the screen real estate. \n \n> Regarding reliability of video drivers: Running many different things, \n> hardware- and driver-wise, over time, I have learned that \n> dpkg-reconfigure is your friend, especially \n> \n> dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-2.6.32-5 \n> \n> which regenerates the initrd.img.

In my earlier experiences I would just wipe the drive and start \nover when I suspected that hangovers from previous experiments with \ndrivers were getting in the way of new configurations. But after I \nbecame comfortable with a few different methods of installation and \ninitial configuration I started paying attention to things like \ndpkg-reconfigure and debconf-show. \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
