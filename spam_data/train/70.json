    "body": "Hi all. \n \nI´m working in a project that we would like to install in a touch-screen compact computer. My intention is to use Debian as the OS, and i'm searching for that kind of hardware with support for Debian/Linux. Most of them support Windows but it´s not clear if Debian will work as well. I've found some support for touch screens (some models), but not clear for integrated/compact systems. Someone knows where to look for?, or has some experience?, some URL? \n \nThanks in advance, \n-- \nJose Manuel Pérez (+34 943 018705) \nRedes y Sistemas / Sarea eta Sistemak \nRed Académica i2basque Sare Akademikoa \n-- \n \n \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
