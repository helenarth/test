But be sure to add the optional flag to the LinuxOld \nsection in /etc/lilo.conf. Without it, lilo will generate an error if \nthere are not at least two kernels installed. \n> \n> Any chance of you posting the customization instructions on \n> your Web site? \n \nWell, I already have, sort of. The trouble is that it's buried in a \nlarger document on custom kernel building. People see that and think, \n\"Oh, I'm not building a custom kernel; so I don't need to read this.\" \nBut Step 10 on my kernel building page \n \n http://www.wowway.com/~zlinuxman/Kernel.htm \n \ntalks about customizing the kernel installation environment, and that \npart is applicable to both stock and custom kernels. The instructions \nfor customizing the Lenny environment work for Squeeze also, provided \nthat you use *only* stock kernels. The minute you introduce a custom \nkernel, you *must* use the hook scripts, as documented in the Squeeze \nsection. \n \n> Stephen Powell wrote: \n>> There is a newer kernel available in squeeze now, 2.6.32-5. \n> \n> Sid isn't it?

If you need \ninstructions for how to pull in the Sid kernel without upgrading \nyour whole system to Sid, let me know and I can provide that. \nAlso, you might try disabling ACPI and try the vesa driver, \nas explained in another post. \n \n-- \n .''`.
