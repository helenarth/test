VALOUR! COMPASSION! (12.40am, Fri, C5)... Jarvis Cocker\n *is* Rolf Harris, while \"Allstars\" impersonate the recently\n deceased \"Steps\" in CELEBRITY STARS IN THEIR EYES (8.30pm,\n Sat, ITV)... Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma \"Legally Blonde\"\n Blair put the \"les\" back into \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\" in\n their noted http://www.girlskissing.co.uk/video.htm classic\n CRUEL INTENTIONS (9.30pm, Sat, C4)... leading into a late-\n night character actor fest featuring Paul \"Boogie Nights\"\n Anderson's feature debut HARD EIGHT (12.35am, Sat, BBC2),\n David Mamet's Steve Martin con-game THE SPANISH PRISONER\n (1.20am, Sat, C4), and Oirish juvenile delinquent coming-of-\n ager THE BUTCHER BOY (12.55am, Sat, C5)... things get back to\n normal on Sunday with the incomprehensible remake of MISSION:\n IMPOSSIBLE (8.15pm, Sun, BBC1) - not to be confused with the\n simultaneously fruitless THE HUNT FOR THE ANTHRAX KILLER (9pm,\n Sun, BBC2)... Christina Ricci, Lisa Kudrow comedy THE OPPOSITE\n OF SEX (10pm, Sum, C4) has snappy script, no plot... and it's\n the final episode of the seemingly interminable 24 (10pm, Sun,\n BBC2): http://www.doyourecall.co.uk/ ... the - presumably\n rhetorically titled - DID BARRY GEORGE KILL JILL DANDO? (9pm,\n Mon, C4) and WHO KILLED SIMONE VALENTINE? (11.05pm, Mon, C4)\n are helpfully scheduled either either side of SIX FEET UNDER\n (10pm, Mon, C4)... Michael \"David St Hubbins\" McKean moves\n into management in sub-\"Spinal Tap\" hostage romp AIRHEADS\n (10.55pm, Mon, C5)... the consistently worrying TEENAGE KICKS\n (10pm, Tue, C4) looks at \"Teenage Dwarfs\" - next week:\n \"Teenage Dirtbags\"?... and http://www.diffusiononline.net/\n inspiration BARGAIN HUNT (8pm, Thu, BBC1) arrives on prime-\n time - frankly we still prefer his mix of \"147 Lockdown\"...\n\n FILM>> if they'd used the proper mathematical sigma symbol in\n the title, then the sequel could have been called \"The\n Derivative Of Distress - With Respect To Terror\" for largely\n humourless feelgood nuclear thriller THE SUM OF ALL FEARS\n ( http://www.screenit.com/movies/2002/the_sum_of_all_fears.html :\n We see [Bridget \"Coyote Ugly\" Moynahan] in bed, showing some\n cleavage; the camera briefly focuses on some cheerleaders'\n clothed butts during the Super Bowl)... oh and it's the full\n release this week for SPY KIDS 2: THE ISLAND OF LOST DREAMS\n ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/spykids2.htm : telepathy;\n pelvic thrusts by a child; drinking with multiple drugging;\n \"Let's kick their [posteriors]\" - which is not included in the\n list of three/four letter word vocabulary but is impudent;\n toilet humor - smothering in a pile of dung with fecal matter\n in mouth)...\n\n CONFECTIONERY THEORY>> \"Are you tracking breakfast cereal?\"\n inquired a concerned LLOYD WOOD, after recently wandering into\n the \"kiddy end\" of the cereal aisle. \"They've all gone CD-ROM\n on the front\", he observed - causing him, for a moment to\n think he was looking at \"some really bloated computer\n magazines\". Of course we are, Lloyd, though we're not as\n easily swayed by gimmicks as you are, and thus can impartially\n report that NESTLE's Maryland-style COOKIE CRISP are the most\n biscuit-like breakfast ever, easily triumphing over KELLOGG's\n FROSTIES CHOCOLATE (too much chocolate, not enough \"frosty\"),\n COCO POPS CRUNCHERS (clump together in this humid weather) and\n even the Winnie The Pooh-themed DISNEY HUNNY B's - and if you\n mix them all together, the milk goes so chocolatey it'll turn\n your Pooh brown... elsewhere in dairy, MCDONALD'S continue a\n disappointing run of toppings for the MCFLURRY (99p) -\n Cadbury's Caramel is rubbish, and Jammie Dodgers not a patch\n on our second-favourite McFlurry of all time, the Strawberry\n Crunch: http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02001-08-10&l=286#l .\n Reader ED AVIS complains that KFC don't tell you that their\n \"M&M\" AVALANCHE (also 99p) does not feature real M&Ms but\n \"special miniaturised ones\", which he describes as \"frozen\n solid\" and \"might as well be small bits of gravel for all the\n chocolate flavour they impart\". While, following last week's\n announcement of Ice T's Posse Pops, CRAIG LEFF thought we'd be\n reassured by the news that NBC are launching their own range\n of TV-themed Baskin-Robbins ice-creams, including a \"Fear\n Factor\" flavour designed to recreate the experience of eating\n \"dirt and spiders\": http://www.adage.com/news.cms?newsId=35520\n ... back with confectionery, LEON VERRALL remained unimpressed\n with STARBURST FRUITINESSE (from 49p, \"tasted of plastic...\n [resembled] those 'food pills' they thought we'd all be eating\n by now\"), DAVID BLANE grudgingly approved of the TWIX TRIPLE\n CHOC LIMITED EDITION (\"Not bad, faintly evoking Penguins,\n which I never liked because of the thick chocolate\"), and the\n whole point of that controversial \"It's not for girls\"\n campaign was revealed: to position NESTLE DOUBLE CREAM (40p)\n as a more female-friendly version of the YORKIE BAR. Other\n treats to look forward to in coming weeks: Cola-flavoured\n CADBURY-TREBOR REFRESHERS, chicken-wings-flavoured HULA HOOPS,\n bacon QUAVERS, the (presumably) non-crisp-like GOLDEN WONDER\n FRUIT WONDERS - or, indeed, any of this weird new American\n stuff: http://www.candyusa.org/Press/New/ace2002.shtml ,\n ranging from SCORNED WOMAN CHOCOLATE JALAPENO FUDGE to SOFT\n AND CHEWY STINKY FEET (\"Mmm, these feet are *so* stinky\")...\n\n\n >> SMALL PRINT 500KB attachments is forbidden by the Geneva Convention.\n Your country may be at risk if you fail to comply.",
