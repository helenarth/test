    "body": "Hello, \n \nI have a web-service that produces static images from various sources using Quartz. \n \nRecently I wanted to add the capability of adding QTMovie screenshots there, but I'm having some issues. \n \nWhen the service is run by a user which currently has a graphical login, it works fine - I can load a QTMovie, and grab a frame from a specific time to be used in the image export. \n \n \nHowever, in the production environment, the app is run by a user which is not logged in. Everything else (Quartz) works fine, but QTMovie loading bails out with this: \n \n/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component/AVA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011 \n/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component/AVA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011 \n_RegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to the WindowServer, _CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL \n/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component/AVA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011 \n \nIs there a way to work around this? I only want to get the poster image from that movie, nothing else. I can detect in my code when I'm not connected to the windowserver with CGGetOnlineDisplayList, so I can switch to a different code path if required. \n \nRegards, \nOrestis Markou _______________________________________________ \nDo not post admin requests to the list.
