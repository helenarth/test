However, \n> I've just bought a new 1080p TV and connected it to the computer via HDMI. \n> This unfortunately has permanently knocked the resolution down on the \n> monitor to 800x600, which is next to unusable. Would anyone with a similar \n> configuration be willing to share an xorg.conf or share some advice on this. \n> I think I'd like the monitor to be either 1280x960, 1152x864, 1024x768 and \n> the TV to work at 1600x900 1366x768 or 1280x720. \n> \n> \n> Thanks for any help! \n> Jim \n> \n \n \n \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
