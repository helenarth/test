I told a friend I wanted a server distro that \nwasn't going to spoon feed me, but make me learn something about Linux. \n \nCasey, a seasoned Debian sysadmin, recommended I download the Debian net \ninstall floppies and do my first install from the mirrors, only a compact \nbase install, and to install everything else I needed by hand with apt. \nThat was Potato with a 2.2 kernel. \n \nI only use Linux for non-GUI servers. I don't use desktop Linux. All my \nadmin'ing requires knuckle busting. ;) And I like it that way. \n \n-- \nStan \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
