It might even work if you first open, then delete, before writing random data if you prefer that. \n \nBut it might be that you are better off finding a command-line tool that handles the secure deletion for you, and create a Swing app that delegates the heavy lifting to the command-line tool. Low-level file system access isn't really one of Java's strong points, as its foucs has always been being cross-platform (Java 7's NIO.2 functionality might fix some of these issues though) . \n \n \nBest regards, \n \n-- \nHarald K _______________________________________________ \nDo not post admin requests to the list.
