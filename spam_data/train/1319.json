Thus it seems that the fdi directives are working \nright now on my Sid system. (As I wrote earlier, I have not used these \nfeatures in a long while, therefore I do not know if the fdi files \nworked all the time or if this functionality was only recently \nrestored.) \n \nI suggest that you try the same approach and then we can compare our \nresults. In other words: \n \n1) Shut down X and remove your custom udev rules for the time being, \n then restart udev. (invoke-rc.d udev restart) \n \n2) Uncomment the extra rules in \n /usr/share/hal/fdi/policy/20thirdparty/11-x11-synaptics.fdi. You have \n to close the comment in the \"\" to \n the end of this line; also insert a new line with \"",
