And, as I said, \nI'm also just genuinely interested in seeing how well I can do without \nthe proprietary bits. The resolve is made all the stronger by my \nexperiences in industry where I see what I think are some pretty unwise \ndecisions being made by companies who are often unwittingly tying their \nfortunes irrevocably to the whims (business models, I think they call \nthem) of other companies -- companies whose interests might (and do) run \nin a counter direction. \n \nThe industries I've worked in might not have had very many choices (at \nleast without incurring huge development costs) when making their \nhardware / software decisions. But, as an individual, I can do what I \ndanged well please -- even if others may think that it looks like I'm \njust cutting off my nose to spite my face. \n \n;) \n \n> [1] \"Firmware\" here is specifically limited to executable data transmitted to \n> the device from a host operating system, and does not include executable data \n> loaded from an EEPROM (or similar) that is provided with the device. \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
