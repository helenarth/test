    "body": "Hello there. I own a dell studio 1555 with an ATI Mobility Radeon HD4570. I \nhave a debian testing installation and currently I have to use either radeon \nor the radeonhd drivers cause the proprietary (fglrx) driver doesn't support \nthe xserver currently available in testing. Everything works just fine. I \neven got 3d acceleration and Kwin effects. The problem is that the xorg \nprocess is using the cpu and consuming much memory. The memory consumed is \nabout 160MB but that doesn't really bother me cause I got plenty of it :P. \nWell the annoying thing is the cpu fan; xorg uses about 10% (as shown in \nkde's system monitor) and so the fan does never stop. Has anyone else \nspotted any high cpu usage when using those drivers? If I disable the kde \neffects the memory consumption gets lower but the cpu is still in heavy use \nby the xorg process. \n \n \nWell I got a few more questions about these open source drivers. Does anyone \nknow if they have power saving enabled? I think when I used the fgrlx driver \nthe battery lasted much longer. I also got an issue with suspend. It worked \nwith the fglrx driver but with the opensource drivers the laptop doesn't \nwake up. Well it does but the display shows nothing. I have to play with \nalt+ctrl+f* before it shows something. Then if I type my pass I can see that \nthe s2ram process is consuming 50% of the cpu! One time when doing so the \nlaptop turn off by itself. I think it overheated so that makes me think that \nsomething goes wrong with the acpi after waking up from suspend. \n \nSorry for the long post. Thanks in advance for any help. \n \nJ",
