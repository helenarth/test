Morgan began coverage on AOL Time Warner with a \"buy\" rating, CNET's Tech index fell 26.23 points, or 2.66 percent, to 965.29. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 35.11 points, or 2.54 percent, to 1,346.01--a multi-year low.\n \nBroader markets also shed value, dragged down in part by a troubled pharmaceutical sector. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 282.5 points, or 3.11 percent, to 8,813.5, and the S&P 500 slid 32.36 points, or 3.52 percent, to 920.47--also a multi-year low.\n \n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nAT&T, Comcast Shareholders OK Broadband Deal \nShareholders of AT&T Corp. and Comcast Corp. on Wednesday approved the planned $27 billion merger of AT&T Broadband with Comcast, which will create the nation's largest cable TV operator with more than 22 million customers.\nTelephone giant AT&T in December agreed to sell its cable television unit to Comcast as part of a restructuring that dismantled its vision of becoming a one-stop shop for telephone, data and video services. AT&T CORP 9.78 -2.30% \n \n$215 million later, start-up Pluris shuts down \nNetworking start-up Pluris will release a statement Wednesday announcing it has closed its doors because of a lack of funding and ongoing woes in the market it serves, according to a spokeswoman familiar with the company's plans.\nPluris, a once promising company, burned through $215 million over the past few years as it attempted to build a high-end router that was intended to outclass similar products from competitors such as Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems. CISCO SYSTEMS 13.51 2.82% \n \nWorldCom contracts under U.S. scrutiny \nThe accounting scandal at WorldCom has prompted U.S. government agencies to scrutinize the telecommunications company's billions of dollars in federal contracts.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, for one, has been forced to take stock of the situation quickly. WorldCom is a finalist for a 20-year, $3.5 billion contract with the FAA. The contract is expected to be awarded as soon as this week. The company is the incumbent on the contract, which supplies phone and data infrastructure to the nation's air traffic control systems.

But a roughly 6 percent dip in revenues during the second quarter will be offset by the elimination of losses from the discontinued hard disk drive business, Wagonfeld predicts. In IBM's second-quarter results, he expects continued weakness in hardware but relative strength in software and outsourcing. The company's decision to exit or restructure unprofitable, commodity businesses is sound, Wagonfeld says. He reiterates a \"buy\" rating on IBM.
