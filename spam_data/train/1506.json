    "body": "Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with \nno reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to \nbe that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la \nWilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, \nev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more \npartners than women. I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether \nthe fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely \npromiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get \neven more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other \nmen. \n\n\nhttp://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html\n\n>\n\n\nAs for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme \npromiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the \nBand Played On. He writes about bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses \nhow, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you \nmight call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having \nmany partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an \nexplicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.\n That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of \nSchiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and bathhouse culture played \nin spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many \nothers. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that \nthere was a cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.\n\nTom",
