KDE 3.5 is considered \ndead. Why some motivated person has not forked it yet has escaped me. \n \nIf I had the time, resources, and ability, it would be worthwhile to me \nto see the KDE 3.5 codebase live on. If nothing else, the Lenny source \ntarballs would be a starting point for a new branch. I'd expect some \npushback from the KDE devs so it's likely the fork could not call itself \nKDE. Some will say that KDE 3.5 can go no further which was also said \nof XMMS which spawned Beep Media Player which spawned Audacious which is \nalive and well, last I checked. As I see it, KDE4 has been given 2+ \nyears to match KDE 3.5 and they've been unable to do so thus the time \nhas come for someone to seriously consider reviving the KDE 3.5 \ncodebase. \n \n> I really feel sorry that KDE 3 series is no more being developed, and \n> when the day cames that I no longer will be able to use KDE 3, I will \n> switch to Apple or even Windows, but NEVER to kde4 or Gnome! \n> (and I feel many users out there think like me!!!) \n \nWell, don't go throwing the baby out with the bathwater as we say over \nhere! I felt the same way but even though it is quirky, XFCE works \nfairly well as does GNOME in Linux Mint 8. Still, either pales in \ncomparison to the KDE 3.5 as does KDE4 but at the end of the day, the \nDE is really not why I use a Linux distribution in the first place. So \njumping to a proprietary OS is not an option. \n \n- Nate >> \n \n> Thank you, keep the good work, Debian is one of the best. \n \nAgreed. No matter the distro I choose, they are all Debian based. \n \n- Nate >> \n \n-- \n \n\"The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all \npossible worlds.
