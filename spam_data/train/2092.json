The company's stock \ndipped below three this week. And network execs \nare openly questioning whether the digital recorder, \nwhich permits skipping commercials with a few \nclicks of the remote, will destroy their advertising \nmodels. There even have been hints that the \nnetworks could support a move by the cable \nindustry to offer a PVR that does not permit \ncommercial skipping. And that PVR would not \nbe a TiVo. \n \nTo its credit, TiVo has been remarkably successful \nat building brand loyalty and awareness. TiVo \nreports that 97 percent of its subscribers have \nrecommended the service to a friend. And when \npeople talk about PVRs, they say TiVo. (Just \nlike the way people say \"Coke\" when they talk \nabout soft drinks. ) \n \nBut Wall Street, the media and the industry \nare all growing impatient. TiVo needs to start \nputting some big numbers on the board -- \nand it needs to do it this holiday season. If \nit doesn't, stock analysts who have supported TiVo \nuntil now will run for the hills. That will push \nthe company's stock price down even further. And \nif that happens, TiVo could have just two choices: \nSell the company under duress or wait until its \nfunding dries up. \n \nConsequently, I predict that TiVo will launch \nan intensive marketing blitz over the next \nfive months, right through the holiday season. \nThe blitz will include a sharp increase in \nretail distribution, TV advertising and PR \nefforts. The company needs to show Wall \nStreet -- and the industry -- that it will be \nthe brand leader in the PVR category. And it \nneeds to show that it can generate \nmass consumer demand. \n \nHow does TiVo demonstrate that? \n \nAnything short of 750,000 subs at year's end \nwill have people questioning whether TiVo has \nthe right stuff. Cable execs, who are watching \nTiVo closely, might decide that adding the \nservice is not such a great selling point \nafter all. And Echostar, which currently does \nnot have an agreement with TiVo, may decide \nto stay with its unbranded PVR service after \nits merger with DIRECTV is approved in D.C. \n(TiVo currently has a partnership with DIRECTV, \nbut it's unclear what will happen to the deal if \nthe merger is approved.) \n \nSo there is much at stake -- and it's not extreme \nto say that TiVo's ultimate future could be decided \nin the next several months. \n \nWill it succeed? I predict that TiVo will achieve \na partial success. The company will boost its \nsubscriber numbers and it will maintain its claim \nas the #1 PVR service. However, in time, I \nalso predict it will decide to sell the company \nto a large media outfit, such as Sony or perhaps \neven Liberty Media. This would give TiVo the \nnecessary funding and industry connections \nfor long-term growth and survival. \n \nTo see more predictions on the future of TV, \nclick below! \n\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nBreaking News\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nhttp://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=tpysjsn6.e9iqjsn6.rqhvuqn6&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tvpredictions.com\nDid you know that... \n \n* Cox Cable has decided to slow down its \nroll-out of Video on Demand? \n \n* Consumers have no idea what HDTV is \nall about, according to a new study? \n \n* One top network exec says viewers may \nsoon have to pay for off-air, free TV? \n \n* According to the Associated Press, \nthe cable news networks may be spreading fear \nin our culture? \n \n* Las Vegas says West Wing's Martin Sheen \nis a shoo-in for a Best Actor Emmy? \n \nThese are just some of the many stories now \navailable for reading at TVPredictions.com \nYou can also read our prediction on CNN and \nLarry King, our expose of Forrester Research \nand Josh Bernoff, and perhaps our most \nprovocative story, \"Sex and the Interactive \nTV.\" \n \nClick below to get the latest on the future of \nTV! \n\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nComing Attractions!\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nhttp://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=tpysjsn6.e9iqjsn6.rqhvuqn6&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tvpredictions.com\nThe TVPredictions.com newsletter is published \nevery Friday.
