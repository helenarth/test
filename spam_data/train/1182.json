(the root zone) \n \nMy Domain SMB knowledge is slightly rusty but here goes... \n \n1. Your Samba server's ip address ends with a 0, which, AFAIK, is \nreserved for network addresses (unless it has some special purpose \nlike the the /32 netmask). What is the output of \"ifconfig -a\"? \n \n2. In your smb.conf: \n \n2.a The following are missing (although they may be the default \nsettings for these variables): \nsecurity = user \nlocal master = yes \n \n2.b I have forgotten why, but AFAIK \"127.0.0.1\" should be listed in \n\"interfaces =\". \n \n2.c What does \"share modes = No\" do? \n \n3. If you have not yet created a computer account for the Windows box, \nyou have to log on to the domain as root (or as a user with the right \nto add a machine account) the first time that you do so from a Samba \nclient for the \"add machine script =\" variable to do its magic. \n \n4. The \"_ldap._tcp....\" DNS SRV records are needed for an AD domain \n(IIRC there are 6 +-1). I have never set up an AD Samba PDC but your \nsmb.conf settings look like those of an NT4 Samba PDC so it may just \nbe a misleading error/failure message. Your Windows box seems to be an \nXP VM but just in case the netbios name is misleading, see \nhttp://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Windows7 \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
