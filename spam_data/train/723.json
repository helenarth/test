Which I infer means \nsomething you don't want. \n \nCould you maybe rephrase the question, or at least be a bit more verbose? \n \n... \n \nIf you want the output to go to a file try something like (sed -ne '1,2p;4p' \n\"$input\" > \"$output\"). \n \n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr. ,= ,-_-. =. \nbss@iguanasuicide.net ((_/)o o(\\_)) \nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy `-'(. .)`-' \nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/ \\_/",
