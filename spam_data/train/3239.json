That creates a new network place I can connect to. \n \nAfter that, I open the FTP session by providing credentials and copy a \nlocal file to remote FTP location and is stored fine, no error message or \nsomething that indicates the PUT operation has failed. \n \nThen, if I connect from another dedicated FTP client, I can see the new \nfile there, so all looks good. \n \nHave you tested with another FTP server? \n \nP.S. AFAIK, I don't have installed \"gvfs-fuse\". \n \nGreetings, \n \n-- \nCamaleón \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
