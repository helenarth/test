    "body": "After one of the recent QuickTime updates QT Player 7 (Pro) seems to \nhave lost its ability to record movies from video digitizer \ncomponents. It shows preview all right but once the user presses the \nRecord button, it writes exactly one frame to the .mov file and stops \nwith the error message \"Recording stopped because the maximum duration \nfor the file has been reached\". The same thing happened with all vdigs \nI have installed on my Mac, including Apple's SoftVDigX sample. \n \nQT Player does record movies from iSight but unfortunately it's not \ndoing that via QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer (otherwise it would be \npossible to trace QT component calls and find the difference between \nApple's vdig and mine). And every piece of software that works with \nQuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer, works with my vdig too. Ugh... \n \nThe following versions do NOT work for me: \n \nQuickTime Player 7 Version 7.6.6 (1709) + QuickTime Version 7.6.6 \n(1729) + Mac OS X 10.6.3 \nQuickTime Player Version 7.6.6 (1632) + QuickTime Version 7.6.6 (1674) \n+ Mac OS X 10.5.8 \n \nThis one (still) does work: \n \nQuickTime Player Version 7.6.4 (518.35) + QuickTime Version 7.6.4 \n(1327.73) + Mac OS X 10.4.11 \n \nDoes anyone know a way to make a vdig component (say, SoftVDigX) \ncompatible with the latest QT Player 7? \n \nThanks in advance, \n-Slava \n _______________________________________________ \nDo not post admin requests to the list.
