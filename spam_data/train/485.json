Your scheme would require closed specifications and closed \nsoftware to work. This list, however, is all about free software. \n \n- -- \nJohannes \n \nIn questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the \nhumble reasoning of a single individual. \n- - Galileo Galilei, physicist and astronomer (1564-1642) \n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- \nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (GNU/Linux) \n \niEUEARECAAYFAkvNS+oACgkQC1NzPRl9qEVM2wCfQpAVsTAx7GnbTUminwiqUIlp \ncm4AlRF4NIAhaaT6neYDcg0rYaXGs+k= \n=XYrP \n-----END PGP SIGNATURE----- \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
