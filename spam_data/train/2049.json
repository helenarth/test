And as you mentioned in another post, the dependency to Akonadi has been in place for \na while now (Korganizer and KAddressBook since 4.2). So there's no way in hell you're going to have \n(upstream) support for an Akonadi-less PIM. \n \nOr don't you like the Akonadi dependency to mysql-server? Well, it's not the full mysqld package \nanymore, but the dependency is to mysql-server-core(-5.1) (see #548419). \nSQLite has been found inappropriate since it lacks proper transaction support. \nPostgreSQL is apparently capable of providing the proper features and Tobias Koenig has made Akonadi \nworking with PostgreSQL since the end of last year (http://tokoe-kde.blogspot.com/2009/12/akonadi- \nand-postgresql.html). That patch was committed to trunk at that time, but apparently didn't make \ninto SC 4.4 (?). \nSo if you want to use PostgreSQL, your best bet would be to port/base that patch on 4.4. \n \n> Just block the KDEPIM 4.4 apps from migrating to testing.

And good luck getting any upstream support for bugs resulting from that. \n \nAs Ana indicated the freeze won't wait for SC 4.5, so better make the best out of 4.4. \nIf you want the freeze to wait for 4.5, better try to convince the release team. Good luck. \n \n \nDiederik \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
