Why I have not updated to the latest ones \n(195.x)? Because \"if it works, don't touch it\" and I don't needed to do \nfancy things in that computer and the old version was (and is still) \nworking without glitches. \n \n>>> I'll look into that wiki (again), \n>>> \n>>> \n> it is almost like the old days of potato and woody. had to fresh up my \n> old brain again. so i installed nvidia-glx and the other required \n> packages. that 's nowadays much easier than in the wiki thanks to apt if \n> you start with \n \nYes, I have also encountered the \"Debian-way\" plain easy.
