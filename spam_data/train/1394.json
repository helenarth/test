Weekly, Monthly, or just when you have \na 'major' event? \nHow far in advance of your meeting do you send them? The day before? A \nweek before? Two weeks before? \n \nDo you send HTML based emails? Or just Plain Text? \nDo you keep an archive online of your past Press Releases on your \nwebsite? \n \n \nIf you don't have a PR mailing list, why don't you? \n \n \n \nPLEASE REPLY TO THE *_LIST_* so everyone can benefit from your \nresponses :) \n \n \n-- \nNicholas Pyers (nicholas@appleusers.org) \nFounder & Publisher, AppleUsers.org \n \nhttp://www.appleusers.org/ \n \n \n \n \n \n _______________________________________________ \nDo not post admin requests to the list.
