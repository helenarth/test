I'm using the vesa driver \non the system, not nv. My brain was tracking back to an earlier \nexperiment in which I was using other repositories.

By that I mean that nvidia-glx with this Quadro \ncard has caused all sorts of odd breakages and unreliability issues in \nthe DE. I have done enough experimenting with identical configurations \nof Xfce and Gnome on this system, with the only difference being use of \ndifferent video drivers (vesa, nv, glx/restricted) under both Ubuntu and \nDebian to know that it's not my imagination. I'd rather have a reliable \nsystem than 3D, so glx is a no go for me. The vesa driver has been \nabsolutely flawless, but quite slow, of course. The slowness has been \nworth it because absolutely nothing in the user interface has ever been \nbroken since I went to vesa. I don't game, and I've just learned to be \npatient when switching workspaces. \n \n;) \n \nI'm looking forward to seeing if nouveau will be an improvement, \nperformance-wise, without causing reliability issues. \n \nI am, however, going to wait and install nouveau the easy way, once the \nupgrade to xserver-xorg-core becomes available in the repository. If \nthis weren't my main system I might be tempted to experiment, but I just \nneed this thing to keep working. \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
