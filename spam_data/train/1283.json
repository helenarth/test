If you move the mouse cursor into the \nwindow that pops up, hold it still there and click the middle button, \nyou should see something like this: \n \nButtonPress event, serial 26, synthetic NO, window 0x400001, \n root 0x381, subw 0x0, time 208302587, (103,133), root:(107,155), \n state 0x0, button 2, same_screen YES \n \nButtonRelease event, serial 26, synthetic NO, window 0x400001, \n root 0x381, subw 0x0, time 208302722, (103,133), root:(107,155), \n state 0x200, button 2, same_screen YES \n \nIf it says button 2, your X11 setup is okay. If not, please run this \ncommand and tell us the output: \n \n defaults read org.x.x11 \n \nIf your xev run does give you button 2 events, then there is probably \nsomething wrong with your window manager setup. \n \n- Harald \n _______________________________________________ \nDo not post admin requests to the list.
