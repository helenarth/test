As Nate put it a moment ago, just move \non. \n \n> Are _you_ interested in doing it ? \n \nBackporting KDE4 applications to a KDE3 working environment is beyond \nmy skills. I can't even get Squeeze KDM to use a different background \nas it is. \n \n> At that game, there are two types of players: those who rant and \n> contribute to fix the root of their rant (aka code) and those who \n> rant and do nothing. \n \nGoing back to obsequious pandering is looking very tempting. Yes, us \nmere users have nothing to contribute, since we don't write code. \n \n> We are all volunteers and among those volunteers, nobody is \n> interested in maintaining KDE 3.5 within Debian. I don't see this \n> as a problem; its just a fact. \n \nIndeed. And I assure you, that fact is not lost on anyone. \n \n> Ranting wont change the facts. \n \nLet them eat cake. \n \n> OdyX \n \nCurt- \n \n- - -- \nThose who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, \nfor they do so with the approval of their consciences. \n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- \nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (GNU/Linux) \n \niQEVAwUBS+LLAC9Y35yItIgBAQKlVwf/TpRme9P/nghvduVJ14Lao0+ejEA7Vdro \nAdkSgUIHkxYx1PzcW4qISXkC3VL1ZWz8ZZCxXn6o2Z/C/5582tif4A/tpaeISPfg \nlgC2RSNRLZIGOqo4t9iWWp8cCWbnPMP1GZaq/PRh6AaFDvk+bJ7KdP7Wg/JjK7xE \niilXzb0S+gOYlacvJ6f28Nv9sQJMsLFcqlS4g6F3mKkAEKWERwI5Y36nCunJvdEw \n5/90K1ZWWAv7HMR7iaWmiX61pg6vOru7KewLw+0OesEbdPF28WhCpHqAZHHr4ep+ \nwcP88A/uYa9s+wC/KhGuZ8V12Bfgm/ZL4K8WcTrXhoLXS6RbJhGYEA== \n=svYH \n-----END PGP SIGNATURE----- \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-kde-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
