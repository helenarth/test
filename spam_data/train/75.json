I have googled \naround but cant seemt o find that it would be possible, but it must be \nin some way, us usual. So, any hints? \n \nBasically, add one panel to one monitor, and add a window list to that \npanel. \n \nBest regards, \n Eric \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
