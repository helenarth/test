Ubuntu \nprovides good support for universe, I guess. But, the fact that Ubuntu feels \nthose packages need to be separated just demonstrates that they are \"second- \nclass\". \n \nUbuntu LTS is my second choice, and something I recommend if it is likely that \nthe user wants a commercial support contract. I find the package manager that \nUbuntu shares with Debian to be enough of an advantage to put it above other \nsolutions like RHEL or SLE(D/S). \n \nI am comfortable enough to use and maintain RHEL and SLE(S/D) in fairly simple \nenvironments, if the user has some specific need for one of those systems. \nThat's rare, but is often related to third-party hardware or software being \ncertified with one of those. \n-- \nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr. ,= ,-_-. =. \nbss@iguanasuicide.net ((_/)o o(\\_)) \nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy `-'(. .)`-' \nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/ \\_/",
