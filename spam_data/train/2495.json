I write little snippets \nevery now and again and edit system startup files etc. \n \nThis is certainly a challenge though. I guess if I can interface dyndns.org and \nsmsclient relatively simply with options you mention, I'll probably manage it. \n \nI might also put a check in there for other protocols like http, just in case \nping happens to be the last protocol standing when the machine or connection is \nabout to keel over!
