It's a \n> non-profit group of people with a similar shared interest: a fan club. \n \nI agree that User Groups are now basically fan clubs... or social \ngroups that are bought together through a common interest of the \ndevices and software that one company produces. \n \nBut I disagree that a User Group can't be a \"for profit\" enterprize... \nas there are groups out there that are exactly that - look at some of \nthe Final Cut Pro groups as a perfect example that works extremely \nwell under a \"for profit\" arrangement. \n \n> Nothing more and nothing less.

Apple User Groups should look at how some \nother 'social', 'hobby' and 'fan' clubs work. \n \n> Nobody wants to hear they need to adapt and many are afraid.

You'll be paralyzed by the \n> status quo \n \nWhilst I strongly advise all User Groups that they need to EVOLVE, \nthey don't need to be reactionary with changes. Evolution is a gradual \nchange. \n \nAnd whilst every group needs new members to survive, let alone expand, \nwe have to remember that Marketing 101 theorem that it is often easier \nto retain an existing customer then it is to get a new one. \n \nSo don't suddenly alienate your existing membership, but rather help \nlead them \n \n> I'm not surprised by Apple's success.

Or is it acting like Microsoft that STILL allows you to run \n> WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS on the newest and latest computers? \n \nThere are still places for newsletters and Discs of the Month, even in \nthe 21st century... but again they need to be thought about \ndifferently... and form part of an overall strategy of attracting the \nsame sort of customers that Apple themselves now target. \n \n> I must comment on the irony that while many User Groups want fully \n> elected democratic process each year in their leadership, the User \n> Group Regional Liasons and the User Group Advisory Board, as I \n> understand are not. \n \nThen again, Apple itself isn't exactly democratic in the way it \nappoints its' own board. The Board itself effectively nominates itself \nand then shareholders ratify those nominations.... usually for the \nBoard as a block and not for individual nominees. \n \nAnd shareholders certainly don't get a say in the day to day \nmanagement of the company nor the projects that Apple work on and \neventually bring to market or even kill off before they get to market! \n \n> I hope this leads to an interesting and much needed discussion that is \n> long overdue. \n \nhear, hear :) \n \n \n-- \nNicholas Pyers (nicholas@appleusers.org) \nFounder & Publisher, AppleUsers.org \n \nhttp://www.appleusers.org/ \n \n \n \n \n \n _______________________________________________ \nDo not post admin requests to the list.
