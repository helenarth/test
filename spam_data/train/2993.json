But I \nhave thought about this, and I am not seeing how it wouldn't work. \n \n192.168.11.1 is: \n11000000 10101000 00001011 00000001 \n \n192.168.11.55 is: \n11000000 10101000 00001011 00110111 \n \nSo, the computer at 192.168.11.55 will think it's subnet is the first 22 \nbits of the address, which is 11000000 10101000 000010, which matches \nthe first 22 bits of the router address. So far so good. Client side \nwill think the machine at 192.168.11.1 is on the same IP subnet, so it \nwill do an ARP request for 192.168.11.1 (ARP doesn't care about subnet \nmasks, it just does an Ethernet broadcast), which will succeed, and the \nserver will be able to send to the router. The reverse direction is \nalso true. \n \nWhat am I missing? \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\". Trouble?
