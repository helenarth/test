The upcoming version, the company's first major update of the product since releasing Exchange 2000 nearly two years ago, will by default disable certain messaging features to prevent hackers and virus makers from taking advantage of openings. While Microsoft's biggest nemesis in the e-mail and messaging market is Lotus, the company also competes against Novell and newcomer Oracle, which plans to release its own e-mail and messaging software later this year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nRead the full story\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n IBM puts more bite in 'Shark' \n\nCan IBM's release of a new top-end \"Shark\" enterprise storage system boost the company's prospects in the depressed storage market? Big Blue has fixed many early Shark problems, improving everything from data transfer capabilities to cache size, and adding RAID 10 support and Eliza self-healing features. But IBM faces the still dominant EMC, which last week lured away Mark Lewis from HP to become its new CTO; and Hitachi, which still boasts the technology edge. IBM's edge is its ability to bundle Shark sales with related server and service deals.\n\n \n\n\nRead the full story\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nReport: Linux hack attacks on the rise \n\n\nHackers are increasingly targeting Linux-based Web servers, while the number of successful attacks on Windows systems has decreased, according to a new report. Linux server applications are often vulnerable to attack because of mismanagement, according to the study, which urges Linux system administrators to be more vigilant about patching known security bugs. \n \n\n\n \n\nRead the full story\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrethem worm variant: \"Re: Your password!\" \n\nAn e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with a password is a variant from the pesky Frethem worm family. Frethem.k (aka w32.frethem.k@mm) is a more robust version of Frethem.e, which uses its own SMTP engine to send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. Mac and Linux users are not affected. \n\n \n\nRead the full story\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAn improved CLIE \n\nWith the CLIE PEG-T665C, Sony took everything good about the PEG-T615C--including its terrific color screen and solid design--and added a faster processor and MP3 support to make quite an attractive Palm OS PDA. But with Pocket PCs now selling for less than this CLIE and a whole new Palm OS on the horizon, is this the right time to invest in the T665C?\n\n\n \n\nRead the full review\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite me at dan.farber@cnet.com \n\n Back to top \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Also on Tech Update Today \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCOMMENTARY  \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nHandle employee relations with care \n\nERM is the latest relationship management buzzword.
