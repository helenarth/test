    "body": "Hi all \n \nFrom time to time I have to assess Flash projects, and to assist my marking a few years ago I wrote a program which uses a Scanner to open the .fla file and read it on a \"line by line\" basis. Although this is really stretching what a Scanner should do, it has proven surprisingly useful over the years. \n \nMy original version of the software was written with an \"old\" Xcode style project using the now deprecated jam. Recently I decided I needed to make some changes to it and I thought it would be a good move to transfer it to Netbeans --- and it didn't work! The Scanner wouldn't read a .fla file when run from Netbeans, but it would when run from Xcode, using either a jam or ant type project. It would also work if I navigated to the Netbeans \"dist\" folder and double clicked the jar directly. \n \nThe following code shows the problem: \n \n String fullFileName = \"/Users/boblang1/Desktop/xxx.fla\"; \n \n try { \n Scanner in = new Scanner (new File (fullFileName)); \n while (in.hasNextLine ()) { \n String line = in.nextLine (); \n System.out.println (line); \n } \n } \n catch (Exception e) { \n System.out.println (\"Exception reading file: \" + fullFileName); \n System.out.println (e); \n } \n \nWhen run inside Xcode or by double clicking the jar, the Scanner reads the .fla file. When run inside Netbeans, it appears to open the file but won't return any lines (the while loop terminates early). There are no exceptions reported. \n \nBTW, the problem only seems to happen with .fla files. I can read .txt files quite successfully. \n \nI'm running fully up to date Snow Leopard, with the latest developer preview Java. As far as I can tell, I don't have any older versions of Java on my computer. All the versions in /System/Library appear to link to Java 1.6. \n \nAny ideas? \n \nBob \n \n \n _______________________________________________ \nDo not post admin requests to the list.
