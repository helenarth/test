IIUC, I only has any meaning in the case of \n\"default x\" where x is a number. \n \nIIUC, \"# savedefault=true\" will append \"savedefault\" to the menu \nentries and, booting from one of those entries turns it into the \ndefault at the next boot if you choose \"default saved\". \n \nI have not tried \"default saved\" with grub1, but with grub2 it will \nnot work (the first time that you set it) if you don't run \n\"grub-set-default x\" where x is the default entry that you want (the \ncount starts with 0). \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
