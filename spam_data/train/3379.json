In fact, it was written in the days of Woody. \n(Woody -> Sarge -> Etch -> Lenny -> Squeeze) \nAnd parts of it are obsolete. But the author focuses on the core stuff of \nUnix/Linux, and so most of it is still current. It's an excellent guide \nfor how to accomplish common computing tasks in Linux, usually with a \ncommand line tool, and the author has a clear bent toward Debian. \n \n http://dsl.org/cookbook/cookbook_toc.html \n \nThis is the original version of the book, and it is free. There's an \nexpanded 2nd Edition available in hard copy for a fee. \n \n-- \n .''`.
