TOra will be build without Oracle support \n \nSorry, I can not help you in this. I just downloaded the tora code and \ncompiled it against my oracle sdk which is in the /opt/oracle dir.

I've put it in each version dir respectively. This \nis an extra package. \n \nAlso why would you convert something from rpm to deb, when you can go to the \nvendor and download for free the real code? \n \nI've downloaded and put all I need in /opt/oracle \n \nll /opt/oracle/ \nобщо 20 \ndrwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 6 яну 14,37 . \ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root root 4096 14 дек 2,22 .. \ndrwxr-xr-x 3 emanoil emanoil 4096 22 ное 16,58 instantclient_10_2 \ndrwxr-xr-x 3 emanoil emanoil 4096 14 дек 0,35 instantclient_11_1 \nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 18 6 яну 14,37 lib -> instantclient_11_1 \ndrwxr-xr-x 3 emanoil emanoil 4096 22 ное 16,54 network \n \nexport ORACLE_HOME=\"/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_1\" \nexport TNS_ADMIN=\"/opt/oracle/network/admin\" \nexport PATH=/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_1:$PATH \n \n./configure --prefix=/usr --with-instant-client \\ \n --with-oracle-includes=/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_1/sdk/include \\ \n --with-oracle-libraries=/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_1 \\ \n --with-oci-version=11G \n \nmake \nmake install \n \nthat's it. \n \nI have to admit that for me the biggest challenge was to download the \npackages I need from the Oracle site. \n \nI remember I've tried to debianize once but it failed and I gave up, because \nI didn't have the time. \n \nregards \n \n \n-- \nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
