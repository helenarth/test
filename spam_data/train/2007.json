    "body": "Hi all, \n \nRecently a couple of new machines came to my hands, HP DL 180 G6 with 500Gb \nSATA hard disk, and I tried to setup a 2-nodes ganeti cluster with debian \nlenny. \n \nDefault 2-6-26 kernel does work without any issue. \n \nI've done a fresh installation with nothing more than the basics (vim and \nless ;) ) and after a aptitude install ganeti, editing xen-config.xsp and \ngrub xen options, upon restarting I get the following error on the screen: \n \nApr 15 13:24:56 virt8 kernel: [ 297.381987] ata3.00: exception Emask 0x0 \nSAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x6 frozen \nApr 15 13:24:56 virt8 kernel: [ 297.382163] ata3.00: cmd \na0/00:00:00:24:00/00:00:00:00:00/a0 tag 0 pio 36 in \nApr 15 13:24:56 virt8 kernel: [ 297.382164] cdb 12 00 00 00 24 00 \n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 \nApr 15 13:24:56 virt8 kernel: [ 297.382165] res \n40/00:00:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/00 Emask 0x4 (timeout) \nApr 15 13:24:56 virt8 kernel: [ 297.382595] ata3.00: status: { DRDY } \nApr 15 13:24:56 virt8 kernel: [ 297.382727] ata3: hard resetting link \nApr 15 13:24:56 virt8 kernel: [ 297.858982] ata3: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps \n(SStatus 113 SControl 310) \nApr 15 13:24:56 virt8 kernel: [ 297.914096] ata3.00: configured for PIO0 \nApr 15 13:24:56 virt8 kernel: [ 297.914235] ata3: EH complete \n \nThe installed versions are: \nlinux-image-2.6.26-1-xen-686 \nxen-hypervisor-3.2-1-i386 \nganeti 1.2.6-3+lenny2 \nganeti-instance-debootstrap 0.5-1 \ndrbd8-utils 2:8.0.14-2+lenny1 \n \nI upgraded to kernel 2-6-26-2 to see whether it solved the issue without \nsuccess. \nI also tried booting with clocksource=acpi_pm. I've also just tried \nacpi=off, pci=nosmi, and nocpi as suggests the ata kernel website without \nmuch success. \n \nI've checked through internet and found the following: \n \nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=480317 \n \nIt should be solved because hipervisor version 3.2 is higher than the one \nsolving the issue (3.0.3) unless redhat's version differ much from the \ndebian ones in minnor version....which i don't think. \n \n \nCan anyone shed some light on this issue? \n \nThank you in advance!! \n \nSamuel",
