Individual templates are $5.00 each. \nNew templates added weekly. No link back is required, and web designers \nare not charged higher fees to use them on their clients' sites. \nBrowse the full gallery! \n\nSomehow, it never got mentioned that Lockergnome has a GnomeTome for all \nyou \nDreamweaver users out there. Dennis Jarrett, a gnomie from the UK \nwith a prolific list of writing accomplishments, lent his brain to a list \nof things everyone should know to make using Dreamweaver 4 (and newer) \neasier to use. I 've never actually used version 4, having stuck with 3 \nuntil recently starting the review process of the StudioMX suite, but \nI've been able to apply every tip I tried to some aspect of DreamweaverMX, \nso I can only guess those of you using 4 will want to \ncheck 'em out too.\n \nAs I mentioned in yesterday's Digital Media newsletter, I recently \nswitched cell phones to the \nKyocera QCP6035. \nThe unit is Palm powered, with a screen the size of an m105 and all the \nfunctionality of Palm OS, in addition to having the latest bells and whistles \nyou'd want in a phone. Built in Web browsing, by way of MSN, is slightly \ncumbersome compared to what I'm used to from my cable connection, but I can \nalready see the usefulness in carrying around portable access to things like \ndriving directions. \n \nNow that I've got a way to test the final results in real time, I've got a \nmore vested interest in making Lockergnome considerably more WAP compatible. \nI'm still figuring out many of the phone's features, so that's still going to \nbe at least a few weeks away. Without a doubt, I'll be sharing my experiences \nin WAPing Lockergnome in an upcoming series of articles.\n\n\n\n Jake Ludington        \n\n\n\n\n  GnomeMAIL \nphpMyNewsletter \n\nhttp://gregory.kokanosky.free.fr/phpmynewsletter/ \n\nAs a free solution for managing newsletters, for smaller lists, \nthis does most of what you need. Subscribers are stored in a \nmySQL database, with the ability to send user confirmation \ne-mails. Initially, the address must still be added manually to \nthe database, which isn't idea, but doing this generates a \nconfirmation e-mail with a link that users click on if they want \nto be added. The software purges addresses with no response, \nfollowing an administrator defined waiting period. From the php \ninterface you can send either text or HTML formatted messages, \nwith a built-in preview to make sure your formatting is OK. \nDocumentation is somewhat sparse, so prior knowledge of php and \nmySQL are useful in getting this installed.\n\n \n\n  GnomeTOOLS \n \n\n\n\n\nOpalisRobot v4.0 [60MB] NT/W2k/XP \n\nhttp://www.opalis.com \n\nThink of this as something like \"cron for Windows\" only even more powerful. \nOpalisRobot allows you to schedule almost any process on your server, \nadding an additional layer of functionality, like the ability to program \ntelephony commands to complete administrative tasks. OpalisRobot \neffectively processes e-mail commands, in addition to telephone DTMF tones, \nmaking everything on your server administerable from remote locations, \neven when you can't get remote control access of the machine. Programming \njobs is point-click simple, saving you time even when you schedule tasks \nto save you time. If you operate in a Windows server environment, you're \nadding extra hours to your day and costing your company additional dollars \nby not having this software.\n\n  GnomeSERVER \nPNG Files Do Not Show Transparency in Internet Explorer (Q294714) \n\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q294714 \n\n\"If you browse to a Web page that contains an image that has a transparent \nbackground in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, the image background \nmay appear to be gray rather than transparent.\"\n\nFortunately, Microsoft explains a solution for this problem. Personally, I \nhaven't encountered this PNG display error, but for those of you \nsimplementing PNGs on your sites, you'll want to review the solution.\n\n\n\n \n\nWEB TEMPLATES WITH CSS: Cut your design costs and time with an \nannual membership from BasicTemplates.com. \nFor only $54.95 get access to 250+ Web Templates. \nNew templates added weekly. \n\n\n\n\n  GnomeUSABILITY \n \n\nhttp://diveintomark.org/ \n\nNot only is this information great for improving blog accessibility, it \nhappens to be equally relevant for *any* site. The 30 days are nearing \ntheir end, which means you won't have to wait to find out what's next; \nyou can simply click to the next page. Mark Pilgrim, the site's creator, \nsets the stage with 5 characters (all of which could easily represent \nreal people) and walks through their physical, mental, and technological \nlimitations. Following the character introductions, Mark walks through \nan accessibility scenario each day and then relates the concept back \nspecific benefits for each character's limitations. Solutions are \npresented with blogs in mind, but with very little extrapolation you'll \nbe able to make every site you design more user friendly.\n\n\n  GnomeBLOG \nBackend.UserLand.Com \n\nhttp://backend.userland.com/ \n\nI've been using Radio from the moment I finally got around to creating \na blog. The software keeps things simple and automatically updates \nitself when new things get added. Userland goes far beyond creating a \ndesktop interface for their blogging system though. They've fully \ndocumented all the XML, XML-RPC, and SOAP tie-ins used to connect to \ntheir network, which could easily be adapted to other content \nmanagement applications with some XML knowhow. Backend is the place to \nlook \"under the hood\" at Userland's XML inner workings, including \ndetailed documentation on making everything work. If you've got \nmodifications or improvements to the system, they have an open \ndiscussion forum for trading ideas.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\nhttp://www.lockergnome.com/issues/webmasterweekly/20020712.html \n Your subscribed e-mail address is: [qqqqqqqqqq-lg@spamassassin.taint.org] - To unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page.
